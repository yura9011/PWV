  "content": "// Unity Class: AudioClip\n// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioClip.html\n\n// Description: A container for audio data.\n\n// Properties:\n// - ambisonic: Returns true if this audio clip is ambisonic (read-only).\n// - channels: The number of channels in the audio clip. (Read Only)\n// - frequency: The sample frequency of the clip in Hertz. (Read Only)\n// - length: The length of the audio clip in seconds. (Read Only)\n// - loadInBackground: Enable this property to load the AudioClip asynchronously in the background instead of on the main thread. Set this property in the Inspector (Read Only).\n// - loadState: Returns the current load state of the audio data associated with an AudioClip.\n// - loadType: The load type of the clip (read-only).\n// - preloadAudioData: Enable this property in the Inspector to preload audio data from the audio clip when loading the clip Asset (Read Only).\n// - samples: The length of the audio clip in samples. (Read Only)\n\n// Methods:\n// - GetData(): Fills an array with sample data from the audio clip.\n// - LoadAudioData(): Loads the asset data of an AudioClip into memory, so it will immediately be ready to play.\n// - SetData(): Fills an audio clip with sample data from an array or Span. Overwrites existing data if necessary.\n// - UnloadAudioData(): Unloads the audio data associated with the clip. This works only for AudioClips that are based on actual sound file assets.\n\n// Pseudo-code representation of AudioClip\npublic class AudioClip {\n    public var ambisonic; // Returns true if this audio clip is ambisonic (read-only).\n    public var channels; // The number of channels in the audio clip.
