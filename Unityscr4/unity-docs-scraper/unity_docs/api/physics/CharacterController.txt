// Unity Class: CharacterController
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html

// Description: A CharacterController allows you to easily do movement constrained by collisions without having to deal with a rigidbody.

// Properties:
// - center: The center of the character's capsule relative to the transform's position.
// - collisionFlags: What part of the capsule collided with the environment during the last CharacterController.Move call.
// - detectCollisions: Determines whether other rigidbodies or character controllers collide with this character controller (by default this is always enabled).
// - enableOverlapRecovery: Enables or disables overlap recovery. Used to depenetrate character controllers from static objects when an overlap is detected.
// - height: The height of the character's capsule.
// - isGrounded: Was the CharacterController touching the ground during the last move?
// - minMoveDistance: Gets or sets the minimum move distance of the character controller.
// - radius: The radius of the character's capsule.
// - skinWidth: The character's collision skin width.
// - slopeLimit: The character controllers slope limit in degrees.
// - stepOffset: The character controllers step offset in meters.
// - velocity: The current relative velocity of the Character (see notes).

// Methods:
// - Move(): Supplies the movement of a GameObject with an attached CharacterController component.
// - SimpleMove(): Moves the character with speed.
