This means that the user can’t see their surrounding environment, and can only see virtual content displayed on the screen. The user can only interact with virtual content, rather than their physical environment. VR experiences are often achieved with a headset (a Head-Mounted Display [HMD]), where a screen within the headset displays the virtual environment. VR experiences are fully immersive, and so are a good choice for creating immersive, story-driven experiences and gameplay.\nMR combines elements of the real and virtual environments, enabling users to see and interact with both simultaneously. MR relies on devices that are able to display a real-time view of the user’s surroundings, and blend the real-world view with virtual content. Some headsets, such as the Meta Quest 3, achieve\nMR\nthrough passthrough\ncameras\n, which capture the surrounding environment and display it on the screen. Other devices achieve MR without passthrough cameras, for example the Microsoft HoloLens devices are transparent glasses which project virtual content directly onto the lenses. MR is useful in situations where real-world integration is beneficial, such as training or educational experiences. You can also use MR to create social gaming experiences, or to enhance gameplay with locational information.\nNote:\nOn some modern devices, you can develop an app that has both\nMR\nMixed Reality\nSee in\nGlossary\nand VR modes to allow the user to toggle between these modes within your app.\nConsiderations for VR and MR development\nVR and MR development shares common workflows and design considerations with any real-time 3D development in Unity. However, distinguishing factors include:\nRicher user input\n: in addition to traditional button and joystick controllers, VR devices provide spatial head, controller, and hand and finger tracking (on supported platforms).\nMore intimate interaction with the environment\n: in conjunction with the possibilities of richer input, VR raises the expectations of much closer and physical interaction with the environment than typical 3D games and applications. Users expect to be able to pick things up and interact with objects in the environment. With head tracking, the\ncamera\nA component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ncan get much closer to the walls and other boundaries of the environment and can even pass through them.\nUser comfort concerns\n: many people experience motion sickness in VR when camera movement doesn’t match the movement of their head. You can mitigate the causes of motion sickness by maintaining a high frame rate, offering a range of locomotion options so that users can choose a mode they are comfortable with, and avoiding moving the camera independently of the user’s head tracking.\nTo get started with VR development, use the\nXR\nPlug-in Management system to install and enable XR provider plug-ins for the devices you want to support. Refer to\nXR Project set up\nfor more information.\nBasic VR and MR scene elements\nA basic VR or MR\nscene\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nshould contain an\nXR Origin\n, which defines the 3D origin for tracking data. This collection of\nGameObjects\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nand components also contains the main scene Camera and the GameObjects representing the user’s controllers. Refer to\nSet up an XR scene\nfor instructions on setting up a basic VR scene.\nYou typically need a way for the user to move around and to interact with the 3D world you have created. The\nXR Interaction Toolkit\nprovides components for creating interactions like selecting and grabbing objects. It also provides a customizable locomotion system. You can use the\nInput System\nin addition to or instead of the\nXR\nAn umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nInteraction Toolkit.\nVR packages\nMost of the features and APIs used for VR development in Unity are provided through packages. These packages include:\nProvider plug-ins\nXR Interaction Toolkit\nXR Core Utilities\nInput System\nVR project template\nHand tracking\nVR and MR provider plug-ins\nVR and MR platforms are available as provider plug-ins by the XR\nPlug-in\nA set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nManagement system. To understand how to use the XR Plug-in Management system to add and enable provider plug-ins for your target platforms, refer to\nXR Project set up\n.\nThe following table describes the plug-ins available for VR and MR development, and the devices that they support:\nPlug-in\nMR/VR\nSupported devices\nApple visionOS XR Plugin\nMR and VR\nApple Vision Pro\nOculus Plug-in\nVR\nOculus Rift, Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 3s, Meta Quest Pro\nOpenXR\nMR and VR\nDevices with an OpenXR runtime\nincluding Meta Quest devices, Valve SteamVR, HoloLens\nUnity OpenXR: Meta\nMR and VR\nMeta Quest devices\nUnity OpenXR: Android XR\nMR and VR\nAndroid XR devices\nPlayStation VR\nVR\nPlayStation VR and VR2.

However, this process isn’t complete and there can be feature discrepancies between OpenXR and a headset maker’s own provider plug-in or SDK.\nXR Interaction Toolkit\nThe\nXR Interaction Toolkit\ncan make it easier and faster to develop VR applications. The XR Interaction Toolkit provides:\nAn\nXR Origin\nset up with controllers.\nXR controller\nsetups with Input System presets for basic interactions like select and grab.\nInteractor and Interactable components\nfor creating object manipulation.\nA configurable\nlocomotion system\n.\nXR UI input\n.\nXR Core Utilities\nThe\nXR Core Utilities\npackage contains software utilities used by other Unity XR plug-ins and packages. Typically, this package gets installed in your project as a dependency of other XR packages.\nInput System\nThe Unity\nInput System\npackage not only supports accessing user input from VR controller buttons and joysticks, but also provides access to XR tracking data and haptics. The Input System package is required if you use the\nXR Interaction Toolkit\nor the\nOpenXR provider plug-in\n.\nVR and MR templates\nUnity provides templates for VR and MR development. These templates are accessible from the Unity Hub, and provide a sample scene pre-configured with the relevant packages and components to get started with VR and MR development.\nThe available VR and MR templates are:\nVR Template\nVR Multiplayer Template\nMR Template\nMR Tabletop Multiplayer Template\nTo learn more about creating an XR project from a template, refer to\nCreate an XR project\n.\nHand tracking\nHand tracking is a feature that allows users to interact with a VR application using their hands. Hand tracking is supported by the\nXR Hands\npackage.\nThe Hands package provides:\nA standard\nhand data model\n.\nAn\nAPI\nfor accessing hand tracking data.\nThe\nXR Hand Skeleton Driver\ncomponent, which maps a set of Transforms to their corresponding hand\njoints\nA physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nand updates those Transforms as tracking data is received.\nThe\nXR Hand Mesh Controller\n, which enables and disables a\nmesh\nThe main graphics primitive of Unity.
