// Methods:
// - AddCommandBuffer(): Add a command buffer to be executed at a specified place.
// - AddCommandBufferAsync(): Adds a command buffer to the GPU's async compute queues and executes that command buffer when graphics processing reaches a given point.
// - CalculateFrustumCorners(): Given viewport coordinates, calculates the view space vectors pointing to the four frustum corners at the specified camera depth.
// - CalculateObliqueMatrix(): Calculates and returns oblique near-plane projection matrix.
// - CopyFrom(): Makes this camera's settings match other camera.
// - CopyStereoDeviceProjectionMatrixToNonJittered(): Sets the non-jittered projection matrix, sourced from the VR SDK.
// - GetCommandBuffers(): Get command buffers to be executed at a specified place. This API is only available with the Built-in renderer.
// - GetGateFittedFieldOfView(): Retrieves the effective vertical field of view of the camera, including GateFit. Fitting the sensor gate and the resolution gate has an impact on the final field of view. If the sensor gate aspect ratio is the same as the resolution gate aspect ratio or if the camera is not in physical mode, then this method returns the same value as the fieldofview property.
// - GetGateFittedLensShift(): Retrieves the effective lens offset of the camera, including GateFit. Fitting the sensor gate and the resolution gate has an impact on the final obliqueness of the projection. If the sensor gate aspect ratio is the same as the resolution gate aspect ratio, then this method returns the same value as the lenshift property. If the camera is not in physical mode, then this methods returns Vector2.zero.
// - GetStereoNonJitteredProjectionMatrix(): Gets the non-jittered projection matrix of a specific left or right stereoscopic eye.
// - GetStereoProjectionMatrix(): Gets the projection matrix of a specific left or right stereoscopic eye.

// - RemoveCommandBuffer(): Remove command buffer from execution at a specified place.
// - RemoveCommandBuffers(): Remove command buffers from execution at a specified place.
// - Render(): Render the camera manually.

// - ResetAspect(): Revert the aspect ratio to the screen's aspect ratio.
// - ResetCullingMatrix(): Make culling queries reflect the camera's built in parameters.
// - ResetProjectionMatrix(): Make the projection reflect normal camera's parameters.
// - ResetReplacementShader(): Remove shader replacement from camera.
// - ResetStereoProjectionMatrices(): Reset the camera to using the Unity computed projection matrices for all stereoscopic eyes.
// - ResetStereoViewMatrices(): Reset the camera to using the Unity computed view matrices for all stereoscopic eyes.
// - ResetTransparencySortSettings(): Resets this Camera's transparency sort settings to the default. Default transparency settings are taken from GraphicsSettings instead of directly from this Camera.
// - ResetWorldToCameraMatrix(): Make the rendering position reflect the camera's position in the Scene.
// - ScreenPointToRay(): Returns a ray going from camera through a screen point.
// - ScreenToViewportPoint(): Transforms position from screen space into viewport space.
// - ScreenToWorldPoint(): Transforms a point from screen space into world space, where world space is defined as the coordinate system at the very top of your game's hierarchy.
// - SetReplacementShader(): Make the camera render with shader replacement.
// - SetStereoProjectionMatrix(): Sets a custom projection matrix for a specific stereoscopic eye.
// - SetStereoViewMatrix(): Sets a custom view matrix for a specific stereoscopic eye.
