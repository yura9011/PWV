2D physics
Unity’s physics system lets you handle 2D physics to make use of optimizations available with 2D. You can use the following physics 2D components with Unity:

Description
Rigidbody 2D
Learn how
Rigidbody
A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.

Glossary
2D works.
Collider 2D
Understand the types of
Collider
An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.

2D components available to use with Rigidbody 2D.
Effectors 2D
Approaches and techniques to working with the forces of physics when
GameObject
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.

2D joints
Understand the types of 2D
Joints
A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge.
