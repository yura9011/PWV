Unity provides different physics system implementations which you can use according to your project needs: 3D, 2D, object-oriented, or data-oriented.\nYou can create some basic physics interactions with the user interface, but for more control over the simulation, you need some familiarity with C#. To develop your C# skills, refer to the Unity Learn\nJunior Programmer\ncourse.\nBuilt-in physics systems for object-oriented projects\nIf your project is\nobject-oriented\n, use the Unity’s built-in physics system that corresponds to your needs:\nBuilt-in 3D physics\n: Uses an integration of the Nvidia PhysX engine by default.\nBuilt-in 2D physics\n: Uses an integration of Box2D\nphysics engine\nA system that simulates aspects of physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be affected by collisions, gravity and other forces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nby default.\nPhysics engine packages for data-oriented projects\nIf your project uses Unity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), you need to install the\nUnity Physics\npackage. Unity Physics is the DOTS physics engine that simulates physics in a data-oriented project.\nAdditional resources\nPhysics\nPhysics project settings\n2D physics\nBuilt-in 3D physics\nUnity Physics package\nHavok Physics for Unity package\nPhysics Profiler module\nDisable and strip the physics integration from your project\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
