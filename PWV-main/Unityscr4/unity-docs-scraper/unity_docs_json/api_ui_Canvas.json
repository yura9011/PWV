  "content": "// Unity Class: Canvas\n// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Canvas.html\n\n// Description: Element that can be used for screen rendering.\n\n// Properties:\n// - additionalShaderChannels: Get or set the mask of additional shader channels to be used when creating the Canvas mesh.\n// - cachedSortingLayerValue: Cached calculated value based upon SortingLayerID.\n// - isRootCanvas: Is this the root Canvas?\n// - normalizedSortingGridSize: The normalized grid size that the canvas will split the renderable area into.\n// - overridePixelPerfect: Allows for nested canvases to override pixelPerfect settings inherited from parent canvases.\n// - overrideSorting: Allows for nested canvases to override the Canvas.sortingOrder from parent canvases.\n// - pixelPerfect: Forces pixel alignment for elements in the canvas. It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to Screen Space.\n// - pixelRect: Get the render rect for the Canvas.\n// - planeDistance: How far away from the camera is the Canvas generated? It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to RenderMode.ScreenSpaceCamera.\n// - referencePixelsPerUnit: The number of pixels per unit that is considered the default.\n// - renderingDisplaySize: Provides the pixel dimensions of the display area where the UI canvas is rendered.\n// - renderMode: Is the Canvas in World or Overlay mode?\n// - renderOrder: The render order in which the canvas is being emitted to the Scene. (Read Only)\n// - rootCanvas: Returns the Canvas closest to root, by checking through each parent and returning the last canvas found. If no other canvas is found then the canvas will return itself.\n// - scaleFactor: Scales the entire canvas, ensuring it fits the screen. It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to Screen Space.\n// - sortingLayerID: Unique ID of the Canvas' sorting layer.\n// - sortingLayerName: Name of the Canvas' sorting layer.\n// - sortingOrder: Canvas' order within a sorting layer.\n// - targetDisplay: For Overlay mode, display index on which the UI canvas will appear.\n// - updateRectTransformForStandalone: Should the Canvas size be updated based on the render target when a manual Camera.Render call is performed.\n// - vertexColorAlwaysGammaSpace: Should the Canvas vertex color always be in gamma space before passing to the UI shaders in linear color space work flow.\n// - worldCamera: Camera used for sizing the Canvas when in Screen Space - Camera. Also used as the Camera that events will be sent through for a World Space Canvas.\n\n// Methods:\n// - BroadcastMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.\n// - CompareTag(): Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.\n// - GetComponent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentInChildren(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.\n// - GetComponentIndex(): Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.\n// - GetComponentInParent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.\n// - GetComponents(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentsInChildren(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.\n// - GetComponentsInParent(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.\n// - SendMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.\n// - SendMessageUpwards(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.\n// - TryGetComponent(): Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.\n// - GetInstanceID(): Gets the instance ID of the object.\n// - ToString(): Returns the name of the object.\n\n// Code Examples:\n// Example 1:\n//   using System.Collections;\n\n//   using System.Collections.Generic;\n\n//   using UnityEditor;\n\n//   using UnityEngine;\n\n//   using UnityEngine.UI;// Create a Canvas that holds a Text GameObject.public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour\n\n//   {\n\n//       void Start()\n\n//       {\n\n//           GameObject myGO;\n\n//           GameObject myText;\n\n//           Canvas myCanvas;\n\n//           Text text;\n\n//           RectTransform rectTransform;        // Canvas\n\n//           myGO = new GameObject();\n\n//           myGO.name = \"TestCanvas\";\n\n//           myGO.AddComponent<Canvas>();        myCanvas = myGO.GetComponent<Canvas>();\n\n//           myCanvas.renderMode = RenderMode.ScreenSpaceOverlay;\n\n//           myGO.AddComponent<CanvasScaler>();\n\n//           myGO.AddComponent<GraphicRaycaster>();        // Text\n\n//           myText = new GameObject();\n\n//           myText.transform.parent = myGO.transform;\n\n//           myText.name = \"wibble\";        text = myText.AddComponent<Text>();\n\n//           text.font = (Font)Resources.Load(\"MyFont\");\n\n//           text.text = \"wobble\";\n\n//           text.fontSize = 100;        // Text position\n\n//           rectTransform = text.GetComponent<RectTransform>();\n\n//           rectTransform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n\n//           rectTransform.sizeDelta = new Vector2(400, 200);\n\n//       }\n\n//   }\n\n// Pseudo-code representation of Canvas\npublic class Canvas {\n    public var additionalShaderChannels; // Get or set the mask of additional shader channels to be used when creating the Canvas mesh.\n    public var cachedSortingLayerValue; // Cached calculated value based upon SortingLayerID.\n    public var isRootCanvas; // Is this the root Canvas?\n    public var normalizedSortingGridSize; // The normalized grid size that the canvas will split the renderable area into.\n    public var overridePixelPerfect; // Allows for nested canvases to override pixelPerfect settings inherited from parent canvases.\n    public var overrideSorting; // Allows for nested canvases to override the Canvas.sortingOrder from parent canvases.\n    public var pixelPerfect; // Forces pixel alignment for elements in the canvas.
