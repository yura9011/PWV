Built-in 3D physics
Unity’s default built-in 3D physics system is an integration of the Nvidia PhysX engine. You can use this system in object-oriented 3D projects.
This section includes the following topics.
Topic
Description
Character control
Configure physics-based character control for first-person and third-person characters.
Rigidbody physics
Apply physics-based behavior to
GameObjects
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.

.
Collision
A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion.

Use
colliders
An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.

to configure collisions between GameObjects.
Joints
A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge.
More info
See in
Glossary
Apply and configure joints that connect GameObjects and simulate physical forces for pivoting, movement, and restriction.
Articulations
Configure complex systems of rigid bodies and joints.
Ragdoll physics
Configure ragdoll physics for characters.
Optimize physics performance
Optimize physics system performance in the Unity Editor.
Cloth
A component that works with the Skinned Mesh Renderer to provide a physics-based solution for simulating fabrics.
More info
See in
Glossary
Simulate fabric movement for character clothing and other in-application textiles.
Multi-scene physics
Manage different physics contexts in one project with multiple dedicated physics
scenes
A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

Physics Debug window reference
Use the Physics Debug window to configure and generate visual representations of 3D physics activity in a scene.
Physics Profiler module
Analyze the performance of physics in your application.
