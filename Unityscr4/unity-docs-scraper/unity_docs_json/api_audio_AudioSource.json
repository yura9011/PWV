  "content": "// Unity Class: AudioSource\n// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html\n\n// Description: A representation of audio sources in 3D.\n\n// Properties:\n// - bypassEffects: Bypass effects (Applied from filter components or global listener filters).\n// - bypassListenerEffects: When set, global effects on the AudioListener doesn't apply to the audio signal generated by the AudioSource. It also does'nt apply, if the AudioSource is playing into a mixer group.\n// - bypassReverbZones: When set, it doesn't route the signal from an AudioSource into the global reverb associated with reverb zones.\n// - clip: The default AudioClip to play.\n// - dopplerLevel: Sets the Doppler scale for this AudioSource.\n// - gamepadSpeakerOutputType: Gets or sets the gamepad audio output type for this audio source.\n// - generator: The default IAudioGenerator to play next.\n// - generatorInstance: A handle to the currently playing Generator, if it can be controlled by scripting.\n// - ignoreListenerPause: Allows AudioSource to play even though AudioListener.pause is set to true. This is useful for the menu element sounds or background music in pause menus.\n// - ignoreListenerVolume: This makes the audio source not take into account the volume of the audio listener.\n// - isPlaying: Returns whether the AudioSource is currently playing an AudioResource(Read Only).\n// - isVirtual: True if all sounds played by the AudioSource, such as main sound started by Play() or playOnAwake, and one-shots are culled by the audio system.\n// - loop: Checks if the audio clip is looping\n// - maxDistance: The distance where sound either becomes inaudible or stops attenuation, depending on the rolloff mode.\n// - minDistance: Within the Min distance the AudioSource will cease to grow louder in volume.\n// - mute: Un- / Mutes the AudioSource. Mute sets the volume=0, Un-Mute restore the original volume.\n// - outputAudioMixerGroup: The target group to which the AudioSource should route its signal.\n// - panStereo: Pans a playing sound in a stereo way (left or right). This only applies to sounds that are Mono or Stereo.\n// - pitch: The pitch of the audio source.\n// - playOnAwake: Enable this property to automatically play the audio source when the component or GameObject becomes active.\n// - priority: Sets the priority of the AudioSource.\n// - resource: The default AudioResource to play.\n// - reverbZoneMix: The amount by which the signal from the AudioSource will be mixed into the global reverb associated with the Reverb Zones.\n// - rolloffMode: Sets/Gets how the AudioSource attenuates over distance.\n// - spatialBlend: Sets how much this AudioSource is affected by 3D spatialisation calculations (attenuation, doppler etc). 0.0 makes the sound full 2D, 1.0 makes it full 3D.\n// - spatialize: Enables or disables spatialization.\n// - spatializePostEffects: Determines if the spatializer effect is inserted before or after the effect filters.\n// - spread: Sets the spread angle (in degrees) of a 3d stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space.\n// - time: Audio source playback position in seconds.\n// - timeSamples: The current playback position of the AudioSource in PCM samples.\n// - velocityUpdateMode: Whether the Audio Source should be updated in the fixed or dynamic update.\n// - volume: The volume of the audio source (0.0 to 1.0).\n\n// Methods:\n// - DisableGamepadOutput(): Disables audio output to a gamepad for this audio source.\n// - GetAmbisonicDecoderFloat(): Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.\n// - GetCustomCurve(): Get the current custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.\n// - GetOutputData(): Provides a block of the currently playing source's output data.\n// - GetSpatializerFloat(): Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.\n// - GetSpectrumData(): Provides the block of audio frequencies (spectrum data) of the AudioSource that is currently playing.\n// - Pause(): Pauses playing the clip.\n// - Play(): Plays the clip.\n// - PlayDelayed(): Plays the clip with a delay specified in seconds. Users are advised to use this function instead of the old Play(delay) function that took a delay specified in samples relative to a reference rate of 44.1 kHz as an argument.\n// - PlayOneShot(): Plays an AudioClip, and scales the AudioSource volume by volumeScale.\n// - PlayOnGamepad(): Enable the audio source to play through a specific gamepad.\n// - PlayScheduled(): Plays the clip at a specific time on the absolute time-line that AudioSettings.dspTime reads from.\n// - SetAmbisonicDecoderFloat(): Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.\n// - SetCustomCurve(): Set the custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.\n// - SetScheduledEndTime(): Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will end. Notice that depending on the timing not all rescheduling requests can be fulfilled.\n// - SetScheduledStartTime(): Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will start.\n// - SetSpatializerFloat(): Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.\n// - Stop(): Stops playing the clip.\n// - UnPause(): Unpause the paused playback of this AudioSource.\n\n// Code Examples:\n// Example 1:\n//   //This script allows you to toggle music to play and stop.\n\n//   //Assign an AudioSource to a GameObject and attach an Audio Clip in the Audio Source.
