(Read Only)\n// - button: Which mouse button was pressed.\n// - capsLock: Is Caps Lock on? (Read Only)\n// - character: The character typed.\n// - clickCount: How many consecutive mouse clicks have we received.\n// - command: Is Command/Windows key held down? (Read Only)\n// - commandName: The name of an ExecuteCommand or ValidateCommand Event.\n// - control: Is Control key held down? (Read Only)\n// - delta: The relative movement of the mouse compared to last event.\n// - displayIndex: Index of display that the event belongs to.\n// - functionKey: Is the current keypress a function key? (Read Only)\n// - isKey: Is this event a keyboard event? (Read Only)\n// - isMouse: Is this event a mouse event? (Read Only)\n// - keyCode: The raw key code for keyboard events.\n// - modifiers: Which modifier keys are held down.\n// - mousePosition: The mouse position.\n// - numeric: Is the current keypress on the numeric keyboard? (Read Only)\n// - penStatus: Specifies the state of the pen. For example, whether the pen is in contact with the screen or tablet, whether the pen is inverted, and whether buttons are pressed.\n// - pointerType: The type of pointer that created this event (for example, mouse, touch screen, pen).\n// - pressure: How hard pen pressure is applied, normalized between 0 (no pressure) and 1 (maximum pressure).\n// - shift: Is Shift held down?
