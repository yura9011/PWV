Read this section to learn how to develop 2D projects in the Editor, including how to use sprites, create Tilemaps, and use the 2D physics system.\nMany areas of Unity’s documentation apply to both 2D and 3D development. This section focuses on 2D-specific features and functionality. To choose the right mode for your project, refer to\n2D and 3D Projects\n. For a comparison on two modes, refer to\n2D and 3D mode settings\n.\nTopic\nDescription\nIntroduction to 2D\nUnderstand the available features of 2D projects in Unity.\nGet started with 2D game development\nResources for creating 2D games in Unity.\n2D renderer sorting\nUnderstand how renderers determine priority in 2D projects.\nSprites\nA 2D graphic objects.
