It transfers the required information from the tiles placed on it to other related components such as the\nTilemap Renderer\nand the\nTilemap Collider 2D\n.\nThe 2D Tilemap Editor package is automatically installed when you create a project with the\n2D template\n. You can install the 2D Tilemap Editor directly from the Unity registry via the\nPackage Manager\n.\nTo create, edit, and pick the tiles for\npainting onto a tilemap\n, refer to the\nTile Palette\n(menu:\nWindow\n>\n2D\n>\nTile Palette\n) documentation for more information on its features and tools.\nProperties\nProperty\nDescription\nAnimation Frame Rate\nSet the frame rate at which tile animations play. Increasing or decreasing this value changes the frame rate of the tile animations. For example, if set to 2, tile animations play at double the base frame rate. If set to 3, tile animations play at triple the base frame rate.\nColor\nSelect a color to apply as a tint to the tiles on this tilemap. Set to white (default color) to have Unity render the tiles without tint.\nTile Anchor\nEnter the amount (in cells) along the xyz axes to offset tile anchor positions on the tilemap.\nOrientation\nSelect the orientation of tiles on the tilemap. Each of the following options performs the same function by orienting the tiles along the selected plane.\nXY\nUnity orients tiles along the XY plane.\nXZ\nUnity orients tiles along the XZ plane.\nYX\nUnity orients tiles along the YX plane.\nYZ\nUnity orients tiles along the YZ plane.\nZX\nUnity orients tiles along the ZX plane.\nZY\nUnity orients tiles along the ZY plane.\nCustom\nSelect this option to enable the custom orientation settings below.\nOffset\nSet the position offset of the custom orientation. This option is only available when you set the tilemap’s\nOrientation\nto\nCustom\n.\nRotation\nSet the rotation of the custom orientation. This option is only available when you set the tilemap’s\nOrientation\nto\nCustom\n.\nScale\nSet the scale of the custom orientation. This option is only available when you set the tilemap’s\nOrientation\nto\nCustom\n.\nInfo\nExpand this to view the assets present in the tilemap.\nTiles\nDisplays a list of\nTile Assets\npresent in the tilemap.\nSprites\nA 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nDisplays a list of sprites present in the tilemap.\nAdditional resources\nTilemap Renderer component reference\nTile Palette preferences reference\nTilemap\nTilemap Collider 2D\nTilemap Renderer component reference\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
