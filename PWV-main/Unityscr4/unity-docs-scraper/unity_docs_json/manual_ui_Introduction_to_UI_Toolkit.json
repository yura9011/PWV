If you have experience developing web pages or applications, the core concepts of UI Toolkit might be familiar to you. With UI Toolkit, you can separate the structure, style, and behavior of your UI, similar to how you might with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nUI Toolkit uses the following assets, similar to web development:\nRelationship between UI assets and C# code\nUXML\nUXML\nis a markup language inspired by HTML and XML that defines UI structure and reusable templates. While you can build UI in C#, using UXML is recommended.\nUSS\nUSS\nare style sheets that apply visual styles and layout rules to UI. Similar to CSS, USS supports a subset of standard CSS properties. While you can define styles in C#, using USS is recommended.\nRetained mode architecture\nUI Toolkit operates in a retained mode architecture, which means the UI builds a hierarchical structure and maintains it in memory. The framework handles rendering and updates to the UI based on the state of that tree. Here’s what retained mode means in detail:\nDeclarative structure\nUI components are defined and managed as objects or nodes within a\nvisual tree\nAn object graph, made of lightweight nodes, that holds all the elements in a window or panel. It defines every UI you build with the UI Toolkit.\nSee in\nGlossary\n. Visual tree is an object graph made of lightweight nodes that holds all the elements in a window or panel. It defines every UI built with UI Toolkit. You declare the UI structure once, UI Toolkit takes care of rendering and updates based on the changes to the tree.\nVisual tree example\nState persistence\nThe UI elements in retained mode persist in memory after creation. You can modify their properties, and UI Toolkit reflects changes in the next rendering cycle. For example, if you have a button, you don’t need to redraw it manually. Updating its properties, such as position or appearance, is enough. The system handles the rest.\nEvent handling\nEvents\nsuch as clicks, drags, or key presses are routed automatically to the appropriate\nvisual elements\nA node of a visual tree that instantiates or derives from the C#\nVisualElement\nclass. You can style the look, define the behaviour, and display it on screen as part of the UI.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nin the tree. You attach handlers to UI elements, UI Toolkit propagates events appropriately.\nData binding\nUI Toolkit supports a\ndata binding system\nthat allows you to link properties of UI elements to data sources. This means that when the data changes, the UI updates automatically, and vice versa. This is similar to how frameworks like React or Angular handle data binding in web development.\nData binding example\nLayout engine\nUI Toolkit uses a\nlayout engine\nbased on the CSS\nFlexbox\nmodel. This lets you to define how UI elements are positioned and sized within their parent containers. The layout engine automatically calculates the size and position of elements based on their properties, making it easier to create responsive designs.\nUse flex properties for efficient space distribution, easy reordering, and absolute positioning of elements. The layout engine also supports alignment, justification, wrapping, and much more.\nFlexbox layout examples\nLibrary of UI controls\nUI Toolkit provides a rich library of\nstandard UI controls\nthat you can use to build your interfaces, such as buttons, toggles, and list and tree views. You can use them as is, customize them, or\ncreate your own controls\n.\nStandard UI controls\nText and fonts\nUI Toolkit supports a\ntext system\nthat allows you to work with fonts, styles, and text elements. You can use system fonts or import custom fonts, and apply styles such as bold, italic, or underline. The text system is designed to work seamlessly with the layout engine, ensuring that text flows correctly within your UI.\nText and fonts example\nSupport for Editor and runtime UI\nUI Toolkit lets you create a UI that works seamlessly in both\nEditor\nand\nruntime\nUI. The same UI elements, styling, and layout system apply across both scenarios, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency. Whether you’re building in-game menus, heads-up displays (HUDs), or custom Editor tools, UI Toolkit provides the capability to adapt your UI for different contexts.\nA pie chart appears in both the scene and an Editor window.\nUI tools and resources\nUI Toolkit provides a set of tools and resources to help you design, develop, and debug your UI.\nUI Debugger\nUI Debugger\nis a diagnostic tool that resembles a web browser’s debugging view. Use it to explore a hierarchy of elements and get information about their underlying UXML structure and USS styles.\nUI Debugger example\nUI Builder\nUI Builder\nis a visual authoring tool that lets you create and edit UXML and USS files. You can design your UI visually, drag and drop elements, and customize styles without writing code.\nUI Builder example\nUI samples\nA library of code samples for UI controls that you can view in the Editor under\nWindow\n>\nUI Toolkit\n>\nSamples\n.\nUI Toolkit samples\nRoles and responsibilities\nIn a studio, UI Toolkit can be used across different disciplines, with each role contributing to specific parts of the process.\nUX/UI Designers\nUX/UI designers are responsible for the overall look and feel of the UI. They create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to define the user experience.\nDesigners use UI Builder to visually design the UI and create UXML and USS files for structure and styling.\nDevelopers\nDevelopers implement the behavior of the UI and integrate it with game or editor logic. They work closely with designers to ensure that the UI meets the design specifications and functions correctly.\nDevelopers use C# to create custom functionality, handle user interactions, and bind data. They also use UI Toolkit’s API to interact with the UI controls created by designers and to develop custom UI controls that designers can use and customize in their designs.\nTechnical Artists\nTechnical artists often act as a bridge between designers and developers. They ensure that the visual assets are optimized for performance and integrate well with the UI.\nTechnical artists assist in creating USS styles and troubleshooting issues that arise during development.\nQA/Testing\nQA/testers test the UI to ensure it functions correctly and meets design specifications.\nTesters use the UI Debugger to inspect the UI hierarchy and verify interactions.\nAdditional resources\nGet started with UI Toolkit\nUI Toolkit examples\nUI Toolkit\nGet started with UI Toolkit\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
