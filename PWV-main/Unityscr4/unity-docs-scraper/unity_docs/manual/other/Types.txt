Supported asset type reference
Unity supports many different types of assets and most common image file types. It uses
asset importers
to process and convert external files into assets you can use in your project.
Unity supports the following kinds of files:
3D model files
: Unity supports standard and proprietary
model file
A file containing a 3D data, which may include definitions for meshes, bones, animation, materials and textures.

Glossary
formats. Internally, Unity uses the FBX file format as its importing chain. For a list of supported files, refer to
3D model importers
.
Image files
: Unity imports image files as textures and supports most common image file types. For a list of supported files, refer to
Image importers
.
Audio and video files
: Unity supports many audio and video file formats. For a list of supported files, refer to
Audio and video importers
.
Shader
A program that runs on the GPU.
More info
See in
Glossary
files
: Unity supports different shader file types depending on the graphics pipeline you’re using. For a list of supported files, refer to
Shader importers
.
Text and arbitrary data
: Unity can import arbitrary data from files such as .html, .xml, .json files, which you can use to store and use data from external sources. For a list of supported files, refer to
Text and arbitrary data importers
.
Plug-ins and code related assets
: You can add managed and native
plug-ins
A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).

files into your project to expand the functionality of your application, and
assembly definitions
to create and organize your
scripts
A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.

into assemblies. For a list of supported files, refer to
Plug-ins and code importers
Native assets
: There are a range of asset types that are native to the Unity Editor. For a list of supported files, refer to
Native asset importers
.
Asset importers
Unity uses importers to process and convert external files into assets that can be used in your project. Each file type has a corresponding importer that handles its specific requirements.
Unity supports many asset file types via its collection of built-in importers. Most of these importers are implemented in the Unity Editor’s native code. They provide the import functionality for most of Unity’s basic asset types, such as 3D models, textures, and audio files.
Most importers have a corresponding class in the
UnityEditor
namespace that exposes the same configurable import settings as the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.
More info
See in
Glossary
window for the asset type. They also have corresponding pre-process and post-process callbacks on the
AssetPostprocessor
class so you can define custom behavior to run before or after asset import. For example, the import settings for the
AudioImporter
are configurable in the
Audio Clip Inspector window
or from code with the
AudioImporter
class
. You can also create custom pre-import or post-import behavior for audio assets with
AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessorAudio
and
AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessAudio
respectively. This pattern applies for most major asset types.
3D model importers
Unity uses the FBX file format as its importing chain. For a list of 3D modeling software that Unity supports, refer to

Native asset importers
There are a range of asset types that are native to the Unity Editor. You can create assets of these types using Editor features. When you create these, Unity saves the files which represent them as asset files in the
Assets
folder of your project. These include
animations
,
curves
,
gradients
,
masks
Can refer to a Sprite Mask, a UI Mask, or a Layer Mask

Built-in scripted importers
Scripted importers
allow you to write your own custom importers for formats that Unity doesn’t natively support. Some of Unity’s own built-in importers are implemented as scripted importers because they are written in C# in core packages, rather than within the Unity Editor’s native code itself. Unity imports scripted importer assets after native importer assets.
