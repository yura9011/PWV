XR is an umbrella term that includes the following types of applications:
Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in an artificial 3D world of realistic images and sounds, using a headset and motion tracking.

Glossary
(VR): The application simulates a self-contained environment around the user.
Mixed Reality
Mixed Reality (MR) combines its own virtual environment with the user’s real-world environment and allows them to interact with each other.

(MR): The application combines its own environment with the user’s real-world environment and allows them to interact with each other.
Augmented Reality
Augmented Reality (AR) uses computer graphics or video composited on top of a live video feed to augment the view and create interaction with real and virtual objects.

(AR): The application layers content over a view of the real world.
The span between virtual to augmented reality is a continuum, with mixed reality falling somewhere in the middle, depending on the capabilities of a particular device and the intent of your application.

and components needed by an XR
scene
A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.
