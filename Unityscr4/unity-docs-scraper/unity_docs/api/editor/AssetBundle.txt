// Unity Class: AssetBundle
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html

// Description: API for accessing the content of AssetBundle files.

// Properties:
// - isStreamedSceneAssetBundle: Return true if the AssetBundle contains Unity Scene files

// Methods:
// - Contains: Check if an AssetBundle contains a specific object.
// - GetAllAssetNames: Return all Asset names in the AssetBundle.
// - GetAllScenePaths: Return all the names of Scenes in the AssetBundle.
// - LoadAllAssets: Loads all Assets contained in the AssetBundle synchronously.
// - LoadAllAssetsAsync: Loads all Assets contained in the AssetBundle asynchronously.
// - LoadAsset: Synchronously loads an Asset from the AssetBundle.
// - LoadAssetAsync: Asynchronously loads an Asset from the bundle.
// - LoadAssetWithSubAssets: Loads Asset and sub Assets from the AssetBundle synchronously.
// - LoadAssetWithSubAssetsAsync: Loads Asset and sub Assets from the AssetBundle asynchronously.
// - Unload: Unloads an AssetBundle freeing its data.
// - UnloadAsync: Unloads assets in the bundle.
// - GetAllLoadedAssetBundles: Get an enumeration of all the currently loaded AssetBundles.
// - LoadFromFile: Synchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.
// - LoadFromFileAsync: Asynchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.
// - LoadFromMemory: Synchronously load an AssetBundle from a memory region.
// - LoadFromMemoryAsync: Asynchronously load an AssetBundle from a memory region.
// - LoadFromStream: Synchronously loads an AssetBundle from a managed Stream.
// - LoadFromStreamAsync: Asynchronously loads an AssetBundle from a managed Stream.
// - RecompressAssetBundleAsync: Asynchronously recompress a downloaded/stored AssetBundle from one BuildCompression to another.
// - UnloadAllAssetBundles: Unloads all currently loaded AssetBundles.

// Code Examples:
// Example 1:
//   using System.Collections;
//   using UnityEngine;
//   using UnityEngine.Networking;public class SampleBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
//   {
//       IEnumerator Start()
//       {
//           var uwr = UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle("https://myserver/myBundle.unity3d");
//           yield return uwr.SendWebRequest();        // Get an asset from the bundle and instantiate it.
//           AssetBundle bundle = DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.GetContent(uwr);
//           var loadAsset = bundle.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("Assets/Players/MainPlayer.prefab");
//           yield return loadAsset;        Instantiate(loadAsset.asset);        bundle.Unload(true);
//       }
//   }
// Example 2:
//   //This example shows how to build a scene into an AssetBundle, and then build a Player with that AssetBundle included.
//   //When the Player starts it loads the scene and then unloads after a few seconds.
//   //
//   //To try this example:
//   // - Save it into a file, for example "Assets/AssetBundleSceneLoader.cs".  The source file name needs to match the name of the MonoBehaviour.
//   // - From the Editor Menu select "Example" / "Scene in AssetBundle Example".
//   //
//   //It is also possible to try it in Play mode in the Editor:
//   // - Run the menu at least once to create the scenes and AssetBundle
//   // - Open "Assets/Scenes/StartingScene.unity"
//   // - Enter Play modeusing System.IO;
