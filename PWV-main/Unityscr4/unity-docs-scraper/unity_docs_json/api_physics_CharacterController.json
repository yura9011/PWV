Used to depenetrate character controllers from static objects when an overlap is detected.\n// - height: The height of the character's capsule.\n// - isGrounded: Was the CharacterController touching the ground during the last move?\n// - minMoveDistance: Gets or sets the minimum move distance of the character controller.\n// - radius: The radius of the character's capsule.\n// - skinWidth: The character's collision skin width.\n// - slopeLimit: The character controllers slope limit in degrees.\n// - stepOffset: The character controllers step offset in meters.\n// - velocity: The current relative velocity of the Character (see notes).\n\n// Methods:\n// - Move(): Supplies the movement of a GameObject with an attached CharacterController component.\n// - SimpleMove(): Moves the character with speed.\n\n// Pseudo-code representation of CharacterController\npublic class CharacterController {\n    public var center; // The center of the character's capsule relative to the transform's position.\n    public var collisionFlags; // What part of the capsule collided with the environment during the last CharacterController.Move call.\n    public var detectCollisions; // Determines whether other rigidbodies or character controllers collide with this character controller (by default this is always enabled).\n    public var enableOverlapRecovery; // Enables or disables overlap recovery.
