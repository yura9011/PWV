If not then the absolute distance will be mainta\n\n// Methods:\n// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.\n// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.\n// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any \n// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.\n// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any \n// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a\n// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a\n// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.\n// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor o\n// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.\n// - GetReactionForce: Gets the reaction force of the joint given the specified timeStep.\n// - GetReactionTorque: Gets the reaction torque of the joint given the specified timeStep.\n// - GetInstanceID: Gets the instance ID of the object.\n// - ToString: Returns the name of the object.\n// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.\n// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.\n// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.\n// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.\n// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.\n// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.\n// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.\n// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the\n\npublic class DistanceJoint2D {\n    public var autoConfigureDistance;\n    public var distance;\n    public var maxDistanceOnly;\n    public void BroadcastMessage();\n    public void CompareTag();\n    public void GetComponent();\n    public void GetComponentInChildren();\n    public void GetComponentIndex();\n    public void GetComponentInParent();\n    public void GetComponents();\n    public void GetComponentsInChildren();\n    public void GetComponentsInParent();\n    public void SendMessage();\n    public void SendMessageUpwards();\n    public void TryGetComponent();\n    public void GetReactionForce();\n    public void GetReactionTorque();\n    public void GetInstanceID();\n}",
