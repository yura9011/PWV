  "content": "// Unity Class: ConfigurableJoint\n// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ConfigurableJoint.html\n\n// Description: The configurable joint is an extremely flexible joint giving you complete control over rotation and linear motion.\n\n// Properties:\n// - angularXDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around its local X axis. Only used if Rotation Dr\n// - angularXLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the angular X limit of the joint.\n// - angularXMotion: Allow rotation around the X axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Low and High\n// - angularYLimit: Boundary defining rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.\n// - angularYMotion: Allow rotation around the Y axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Angular YLim\n// - angularYZDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around its local Y and Z axes. Only used if Rotat\n// - angularYZLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the angular Y and angular Z limits of the joint.\n// - angularZLimit: Boundary defining rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.\n// - angularZMotion: Allow rotation around the Z axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Angular ZLim\n// - configuredInWorldSpace: If enabled, all Target values will be calculated in world space instead of the object's local space.\n// - highAngularXLimit: Boundary defining upper rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.\n// - linearLimit: Boundary defining movement restriction, based on distance from the joint's origin.\n// - linearLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the linear limit of the joint.\n// - lowAngularXLimit: Boundary defining lower rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.\n// - projectionAngle: Set the angular tolerance threshold (in degrees) for projection.If the joint deviates by more than t\n// - projectionDistance: Set the linear tolerance threshold for projection.If the joint separates by more than this distance \n// - projectionMode: Brings violated constraints back into alignment even when the solver fails. Projection is not a phys\n// - rotationDriveMode: Control the object's rotation with either X & YZ or Slerp Drive by itself.\n// - secondaryAxis: The joint's secondary axis.\n// - slerpDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around all local axes. Only used if Rotation Driv\n// - swapBodies: Enable this property to swap the order in which the physics engine processes the Rigidbodies involve\n// - targetAngularVelocity: This is a Vector3. It defines the desired angular velocity that the joint should rotate into.\n// - targetPosition: The desired position that the joint should move into.\n// - targetRotation: This is a Quaternion. It defines the desired rotation that the joint should rotate into.\n// - targetVelocity: The desired velocity that the joint should move along.\n\n// Methods:\n// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.\n// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.\n// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any \n// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.\n// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any \n// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.\n// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a\n// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a\n// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.\n// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor o\n// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.\n// - GetInstanceID: Gets the instance ID of the object.\n// - ToString: Returns the name of the object.\n// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.\n// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.\n// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.\n// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.\n// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.\n// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.\n// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.\n// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the\n\npublic class ConfigurableJoint {\n    public var angularXDrive;\n    public var angularXLimitSpring;\n    public var angularXMotion;\n    public var angularYLimit;\n    public var angularYMotion;\n    public var angularYZDrive;\n    public var angularYZLimitSpring;\n    public var angularZLimit;\n    public var angularZMotion;\n    public var configuredInWorldSpace;\n    public var highAngularXLimit;\n    public var linearLimit;\n    public var linearLimitSpring;\n    public var lowAngularXLimit;\n    public var projectionAngle;\n    public void BroadcastMessage();\n    public void CompareTag();\n    public void GetComponent();\n    public void GetComponentInChildren();\n    public void GetComponentIndex();\n    public void GetComponentInParent();\n    public void GetComponents();\n    public void GetComponentsInChildren();\n    public void GetComponentsInParent();\n    public void SendMessage();\n    public void SendMessageUpwards();\n    public void TryGetComponent();\n    public void GetInstanceID();\n    public void ToString();\n    public void Destroy();\n}",
