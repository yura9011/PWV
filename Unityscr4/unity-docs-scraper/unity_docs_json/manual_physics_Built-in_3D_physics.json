You can use this system in object-oriented 3D projects.\nThis section includes the following topics.\nTopic\nDescription\nCharacter control\nConfigure physics-based character control for first-person and third-person characters.\nRigidbody physics\nApply physics-based behavior to\nGameObjects\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n.\nCollision\nA collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nUse\ncolliders\nAn invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nto configure collisions between GameObjects.\nJoints\nA physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nApply and configure joints that connect GameObjects and simulate physical forces for pivoting, movement, and restriction.\nArticulations\nConfigure complex systems of rigid bodies and joints.\nRagdoll physics\nConfigure ragdoll physics for characters.\nOptimize physics performance\nOptimize physics system performance in the Unity Editor.\nCloth\nA component that works with the Skinned Mesh Renderer to provide a physics-based solution for simulating fabrics.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nSimulate fabric movement for character clothing and other in-application textiles.\nMulti-scene physics\nManage different physics contexts in one project with multiple dedicated physics\nscenes\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n.\nPhysics Debug window reference\nUse the Physics Debug window to configure and generate visual representations of 3D physics activity in a scene.\nPhysics Profiler module\nAnalyze the performance of physics in your application.\nAdditional resources\nWorld building\n2D Physics\nManaging time and frame rate\nPhysics\nCharacter control\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
