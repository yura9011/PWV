Develop a native DSP audio plug-in
Native audio plug-in SDK
The Unity native audio
plug-in
A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).

SDK lets you develop custom audio plug-ins for Unity. You can use this SDK to extend the audio capabilities of Unity and create advanced audio processing solutions tailored to your project’s needs. Examples of custom audio plug-ins you can create include
audio effects
Any effect that can modify the output of Audio Mixer components, such as filtering frequency ranges of a sound or applying reverb.

and
audio spatializers
A plug-in that changes the way audio is transmitted from an audio source into the surrounding space. It takes the source and regulates the gains of the left and right ear contributions based on the distance and angle between the AudioListener and the AudioSource.

The native audio plug-in system consists of two parts:
The native audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) plug-in
The managed graphical user interface (GUI)
Refer to the following pages to learn more about how to create an audio plug-in, customize the plug-in’s GUI, and access useful examples.

Example plug-ins
Example DSP plug-ins with and without GUI customization.
Important files your DSP and GUI code uses
The
AudioPluginInterface.h
file has the necessary structures, types, and function declarations required to create a custom audio plug-in.
Both native DSP and GUI DLLs can contain multiple plug-ins. To add multiple plug-in effects within the same DLL, Unity provides additional code to handle the effect definition and parameter registration in a unified manner:
AudioPluginUtil.h
AudioPluginUtil.cpp
If you want your DLLs to contain multiple effects, include
AudioPluginUtil.h
in your code.
