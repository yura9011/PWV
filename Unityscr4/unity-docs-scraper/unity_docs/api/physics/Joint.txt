// Unity Class: Joint
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Joint.html

// Description: Joint is the base class for all joints.

// Properties:
// - anchor: The Position of the anchor around which the joints motion is constrained.
// - autoConfigureConnectedAnchor: Should the connectedAnchor be calculated automatically?
// - axis: The Direction of the axis around which the body is constrained.
// - breakForce: The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.
// - breakTorque: The torque that needs to be applied for this joint to break. To be able to break, a joint must be _Locked_ or _Limited_ on the axis of rotation where the torque is being applied. This means that some joints cannot break, such as an unconstrained Configurable Joint.
// - connectedAnchor: Position of the anchor relative to the connected Rigidbody.
// - connectedArticulationBody: A reference to an articulation body this joint connects to.
// - connectedBody: A reference to another rigidbody this joint connects to.
// - connectedMassScale: The scale to apply to the inverse mass and inertia tensor of the connected body prior to solving the constraints.
// - currentForce: The force applied by the solver to satisfy all constraints.
// - currentTorque: The torque applied by the solver to satisfy all constraints.
// - enableCollision: Enable collision between bodies connected with the joint.
// - enablePreprocessing: Toggle preprocessing for this joint.
// - massScale: The scale to apply to the inverse mass and inertia tensor of the body prior to solving the constraints.

// Methods:
// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.
// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.
// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.
// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID: Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString: Returns the name of the object.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the AsyncInstantiateOperation.
