// Unity Class: RaycastHit
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RaycastHit.html

// Description: Structure used to get information back from a raycast.

// Properties:
// - articulationBody: The ArticulationBody of the collider that was hit. If the collider is not attached to an articulation body then it is null.
// - barycentricCoordinate: The barycentric coordinate of the triangle we hit.
// - collider: The Collider that was hit.
// - colliderEntityId: EntityId of the Collider that was hit.
// - distance: The distance from the ray's origin to the impact point.
// - lightmapCoord: The uv lightmap coordinate at the impact point.
// - normal: The normal of the surface the ray hit.
// - point: The impact point in world space where the ray hit the collider.
// - rigidbody: The Rigidbody of the collider that was hit. If the collider is not attached to a rigidbody then it is null.
// - textureCoord: The uv texture coordinate at the collision location.
// - textureCoord2: The secondary uv texture coordinate at the impact point.
// - transform: The Transform of the rigidbody or collider that was hit.
// - triangleIndex: The index of the triangle that was hit.
