Feature sets are groups of
packages
A container that stores various types of features and assets for Unity, including Editor or Runtime tools and libraries, Asset collections, and project templates. Packages are self-contained units that the Unity Package Manager can share across Unity projects. Most of the time these are called
packages
, but occasionally they are called
Unity Package Manager (UPM) packages
. The
Unity Package Manager
(UPM) can display, add, and remove packages from your project. These packages are native to the Unity Package Manager and provide a fundamental method of delivering Unity functionality. However, the Unity Package Manager can also display
Asset Store packages
that you downloaded from the Asset Store.
