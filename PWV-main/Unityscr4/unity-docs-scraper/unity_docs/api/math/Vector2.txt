// Unity Class: Vector2
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector2.html

// Description: Representation of 2D vectors and points.

// Properties:
// - magnitude: Returns the length of this vector (Read Only).
// - normalized: Returns a normalized vector based on the current vector. The normalized vector has a magnitude of 1 and is in the same direction as the current vector. Returns a zero vector If the current vector is too small to be normalized.
// - sqrMagnitude: Returns the squared length of this vector (Read Only).
// - this[int]: Access the x or y component using [0] or [1] respectively.
// - x: X component of the vector.
// - y: Y component of the vector.

// Constructors:
// - Vector2(): Constructs a new vector with given x, y components.

// Methods:
// - Equals(): Returns true if the given vector is exactly equal to this vector.
// - Set(): Set x and y components of an existing Vector2.
// - ToString(): Returns a formatted string for this vector.
