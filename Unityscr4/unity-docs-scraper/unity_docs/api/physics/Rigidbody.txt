// Unity Class: Rigidbody
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html

// Description: Control of an object's position through physics simulation.

// Properties:
// - angularDamping: The angular damping of the object.
// - angularVelocity: The angular velocity vector of the rigidbody measured in radians per second.
// - automaticCenterOfMass: Whether or not to calculate the center of mass automatically.
// - automaticInertiaTensor: Whether or not to calculate the inertia tensor automatically.
// - centerOfMass: The center of mass relative to the transform's origin.
// - collisionDetectionMode: The Rigidbody's collision detection mode.
// - constraints: Controls which degrees of freedom are allowed for the simulation of this Rigidbody.
// - detectCollisions: Should collision detection be enabled? (By default always enabled).
// - excludeLayers: The additional layers that all Colliders attached to this Rigidbody should exclude when deciding if the Collider can come into contact with another Collider.
// - freezeRotation: Controls whether physics will change the rotation of the object.
// - includeLayers: The additional layers that all Colliders attached to this Rigidbody should include when deciding if the Collider can come into contact with another Collider.
// - inertiaTensor: The inertia tensor of this body, defined as a diagonal matrix in a reference frame positioned at this body's center of mass and rotated by Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation.
// - inertiaTensorRotation: The rotation of the inertia tensor.
// - interpolation: Interpolation provides a way to manage the appearance of jitter in the movement of your Rigidbody GameObjects at run time.
// - isKinematic: Controls whether physics affects the rigidbody.
// - linearDamping: The linear damping of the Rigidbody linear velocity.
// - linearVelocity: The linear velocity vector of the rigidbody. It represents the rate of change of Rigidbody position.
// - mass: The mass of the rigidbody.
// - maxAngularVelocity: The maximum angular velocity of the rigidbody measured in radians per second. (Default 7) range { 0, infinity }.
// - maxDepenetrationVelocity: Maximum velocity of a rigidbody when moving out of penetrating state.
// - maxLinearVelocity: The maximum linear velocity of the rigidbody measured in meters per second.
// - position: The position of the rigidbody.
// - rotation: The rotation of the Rigidbody.
// - sleepThreshold: The mass-normalized energy threshold, below which objects start going to sleep.
// - solverIterations: The solverIterations determines how accurately Rigidbody joints and collision contacts are resolved. Overrides Physics.defaultSolverIterations. Must be positive.
// - solverVelocityIterations: The solverVelocityIterations affects how how accurately Rigidbody joints and collision contacts are resolved. Overrides Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations. Must be positive.
// - useGravity: Controls whether gravity affects this rigidbody.
// - worldCenterOfMass: The center of mass of the rigidbody in world space (Read Only).

// Methods:
// - AddExplosionForce(): Applies a force to a rigidbody that simulates explosion effects.
// - AddForce(): Adds a force to the Rigidbody.
// - AddForceAtPosition(): Applies force at position. As a result this will apply a torque and force on the object.
// - AddRelativeForce(): Adds a force to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.
// - AddRelativeTorque(): Adds a torque to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.
// - AddTorque(): Adds a torque to the rigidbody.
// - ClosestPointOnBounds(): The closest point to the bounding box of the attached colliders.
// - GetAccumulatedForce(): Returns the force that the Rigidbody has accumulated before the simulation step.
// - GetAccumulatedTorque(): Returns the torque that the Rigidbody has accumulated before the simulation step.
// - GetPointVelocity(): The velocity of the rigidbody at the point worldPoint in global space.
// - GetRelativePointVelocity(): The velocity relative to the rigidbody at the point relativePoint.
// - IsSleeping(): Is the rigidbody sleeping?
// - Move(): Moves the Rigidbody to position and rotates the Rigidbody to rotation.
// - MovePosition(): Moves the kinematic Rigidbody towards position.
// - MoveRotation(): Rotates the rigidbody to rotation.
// - PublishTransform(): Applies the position and rotation of the Rigidbody to the corresponding Transform component.
// - ResetCenterOfMass(): Reset the center of mass of the rigidbody.
// - ResetInertiaTensor(): Reset the inertia tensor value and rotation.
// - Sleep(): Forces a rigidbody to sleep until woken up.
// - SweepTest(): Tests if a rigidbody would collide with anything, if it was moved through the Scene.
// - SweepTestAll(): Like Rigidbody.SweepTest, but returns all hits.
// - WakeUp(): Forces a rigidbody to wake up.
