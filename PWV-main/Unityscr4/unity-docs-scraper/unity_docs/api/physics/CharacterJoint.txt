// Unity Class: CharacterJoint
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterJoint.html

// Description: Character Joints are mainly used for Ragdoll effects.

// Properties:
// - enableProjection: Brings violated constraints back into alignment even when the solver fails.
// - highTwistLimit: The upper limit around the primary axis of the character joint.
// - lowTwistLimit: The lower limit around the primary axis of the character joint.
// - projectionAngle: Set the angular tolerance threshold (in degrees) for projection.
// - projectionDistance: Set the linear tolerance threshold for projection.
// - swing1Limit: The angular limit of rotation (in degrees) around the primary axis of the character joint.
// - swing2Limit: The angular limit of rotation (in degrees) around the primary axis of the character joint.
// - swingAxis: The secondary axis around which the joint can rotate.
// - swingLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the swing limits of the joint.
// - twistLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the twist limits of the joint.

// Methods:
// - BroadcastMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag(): Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentIndex(): Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.
// - GetComponents(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentsInParent(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.
// - SendMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.
// - TryGetComponent(): Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID(): Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString(): Returns the name of the object.
