// Methods:
// - BeginChangeCheck: Starts a new code block to check for GUI changes.
// - BeginDisabledGroup: Create a group of controls that can be disabled.
// - BeginFoldoutHeaderGroup: Make a label with a foldout arrow to the left of it.
// - BeginProperty: Create a Property wrapper, useful for making regular GUI controls work with SerializedProperty.
// - BoundsField: Makes Center and Extents field for entering a Bounds.
// - BoundsIntField: Makes Position and Size field for entering a BoundsInt.
// - ColorField: Makes a field for selecting a Color.
// - CurveField: Makes a field for editing an AnimationCurve.
// - DelayedDoubleField: Makes a delayed text field for entering doubles.
// - DelayedFloatField: Makes a delayed text field for entering floats.
// - DelayedIntField: Makes a delayed text field for entering integers.
// - DelayedTextField: Makes a delayed text field.
// - DoubleField: Makes a text field for entering doubles.
// - DrawPreviewTexture: Draws the texture within a rectangle.
// - DrawRect: Draws a filled rectangle of color at the specified position and size within the current editor window.
// - DrawTextureAlpha: Draws the alpha channel of a texture within a rectangle.
// - DropdownButton: Makes a button that reacts to mouse down, for displaying your own dropdown content.
// - DropShadowLabel: Draws a label with a drop shadow.
// - EndChangeCheck: Ends a code block and checks for any GUI changes.

// - EndProperty: Ends a Property wrapper started with BeginProperty.
// - EnumFlagsField: Displays a menu with an option for every value of the enum type when clicked. An option for the value 0 with name "Nothing" and an option for the value ~0 (that is, all bits set) with the name "Everything" are always displayed at the top of the menu. The names for the values 0 and ~0 can be overriden by defining these values in the enum type.
// - EnumPopup: Makes an enum popup selection field.
