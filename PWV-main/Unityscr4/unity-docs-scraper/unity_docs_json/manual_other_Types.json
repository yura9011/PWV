It uses\nasset importers\nto process and convert external files into assets you can use in your project.\nUnity supports the following kinds of files:\n3D model files\n: Unity supports standard and proprietary\nmodel file\nA file containing a 3D data, which may include definitions for meshes, bones, animation, materials and textures.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nformats. Internally, Unity uses the FBX file format as its importing chain. For a list of supported files, refer to\n3D model importers\n.\nImage files\n: Unity imports image files as textures and supports most common image file types. For a list of supported files, refer to\nImage importers\n.\nAudio and video files\n: Unity supports many audio and video file formats. For a list of supported files, refer to\nAudio and video importers\n.\nShader\nA program that runs on the GPU.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nfiles\n: Unity supports different shader file types depending on the graphics pipeline you’re using. For a list of supported files, refer to\nShader importers\n.\nText and arbitrary data\n: Unity can import arbitrary data from files such as .html, .xml, .json files, which you can use to store and use data from external sources. For a list of supported files, refer to\nText and arbitrary data importers\n.\nPlug-ins and code related assets\n: You can add managed and native\nplug-ins\nA set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nfiles into your project to expand the functionality of your application, and\nassembly definitions\nto create and organize your\nscripts\nA piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ninto assemblies. For a list of supported files, refer to\nPlug-ins and code importers\nNative assets\n: There are a range of asset types that are native to the Unity Editor. For a list of supported files, refer to\nNative asset importers\n.\nAsset importers\nUnity uses importers to process and convert external files into assets that can be used in your project. Each file type has a corresponding importer that handles its specific requirements.\nUnity supports many asset file types via its collection of built-in importers. Most of these importers are implemented in the Unity Editor’s native code. They provide the import functionality for most of Unity’s basic asset types, such as 3D models, textures, and audio files.\nMost importers have a corresponding class in the\nUnityEditor\nnamespace that exposes the same configurable import settings as the\nInspector\nA Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nwindow for the asset type. They also have corresponding pre-process and post-process callbacks on the\nAssetPostprocessor\nclass so you can define custom behavior to run before or after asset import. For example, the import settings for the\nAudioImporter\nare configurable in the\nAudio Clip Inspector window\nor from code with the\nAudioImporter\nclass\n. You can also create custom pre-import or post-import behavior for audio assets with\nAssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessorAudio\nand\nAssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessAudio\nrespectively. This pattern applies for most major asset types.\n3D model importers\nUnity uses the FBX file format as its importing chain. For a list of 3D modeling software that Unity supports, refer to\nModel file formats\n.\nImporter\nDescription\nSupported file formats\nFBXImporter\nImports 3D model files.

Some of Unity’s own built-in importers are implemented as scripted importers because they are written in C# in core packages, rather than within the Unity Editor’s native code itself.
