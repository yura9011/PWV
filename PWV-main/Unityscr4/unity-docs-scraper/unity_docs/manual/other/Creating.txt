To add a Terrain GameObject to your Scene, select
GameObject > 3D Object > Terrain
from the menu. This also adds a corresponding Terrain Asset to the Project view. When you do this, the landscape is initially a large, flat plane. The Terrain’s Inspector window provides a number of tools to create detailed landscape features.

Select the paintbrush icon to access painting tools, which allow you to modify the Terrain. Use the cursor to sculpt the height of the Terrain, or paint texture onto the Terrain. Choose from several built-in Brush shapes, or define your own Brush using a texture. You can also change the size and opacity (the strength of the applied effect) of the Brush. Once you’ve defined the properties, your cursor takes the shape of the selected Brush. Click or drag on the Terrain to create different shapes and textures.
Similar to how you paint with a Brush on the Terrain, you can add textures, trees, and details like grass, flowers, and rocks. You can also create additional connected Terrain tiles, change the height of an entire tile, and even write custom Brushes with complex effects.
Terrain Overlay Windows
Terrain tools can be used with overlays. When a Terrain

The
Terrain Toolbar
overlay contains the terrain tools, divided into categories. From left to right, the menu buttons are
Sculpt Mode
,
Materials Mode
,
Foliage Mode
, and
Neighbor Terrains Mode
. If there are custom tools which inherit from

The
Tool Settings
overlay can be found under the overlay with this icon

Set Height Tool Settings
Certain tools may have brush masks. When selecting a tool that has access to brushes, the

Certain tools which have access to brushes may also have access to the

If you press F while the cursor is not over a Terrain tile, it uses the standard framing behavior, framing the selection around the whole GameObject when you place the cursor over the Scene view.
