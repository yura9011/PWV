// Unity Class: Canvas
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Canvas.html

// Description: Element that can be used for screen rendering.

// Properties:
// - additionalShaderChannels: Get or set the mask of additional shader channels to be used when creating the Canvas mesh.
// - cachedSortingLayerValue: Cached calculated value based upon SortingLayerID.
// - isRootCanvas: Is this the root Canvas?
// - normalizedSortingGridSize: The normalized grid size that the canvas will split the renderable area into.
// - overridePixelPerfect: Allows for nested canvases to override pixelPerfect settings inherited from parent canvases.
// - overrideSorting: Allows for nested canvases to override the Canvas.sortingOrder from parent canvases.
// - pixelPerfect: Forces pixel alignment for elements in the canvas. It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to Screen Space.
// - pixelRect: Get the render rect for the Canvas.
// - planeDistance: How far away from the camera is the Canvas generated? It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to RenderMode.ScreenSpaceCamera.
// - referencePixelsPerUnit: The number of pixels per unit that is considered the default.
// - renderingDisplaySize: Provides the pixel dimensions of the display area where the UI canvas is rendered.
// - renderMode: Is the Canvas in World or Overlay mode?
// - renderOrder: The render order in which the canvas is being emitted to the Scene. (Read Only)
// - rootCanvas: Returns the Canvas closest to root, by checking through each parent and returning the last canvas found. If no other canvas is found then the canvas will return itself.
// - scaleFactor: Scales the entire canvas, ensuring it fits the screen. It only applies when Canvas.renderMode is set to Screen Space.
// - sortingLayerID: Unique ID of the Canvas' sorting layer.
// - sortingLayerName: Name of the Canvas' sorting layer.
// - sortingOrder: Canvas' order within a sorting layer.
// - targetDisplay: For Overlay mode, display index on which the UI canvas will appear.
// - updateRectTransformForStandalone: Should the Canvas size be updated based on the render target when a manual Camera.Render call is performed.
// - vertexColorAlwaysGammaSpace: Should the Canvas vertex color always be in gamma space before passing to the UI shaders in linear color space work flow.
// - worldCamera: Camera used for sizing the Canvas when in Screen Space - Camera. Also used as the Camera that events will be sent through for a World Space Canvas.

// Methods:
// - BroadcastMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag(): Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentIndex(): Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.
// - GetComponents(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentsInParent(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.
// - SendMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.
// - TryGetComponent(): Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID(): Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString(): Returns the name of the object.
