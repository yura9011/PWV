The source file name needs to match the name of the MonoBehaviour.\n\n//   // - From the Editor Menu select \"Example\" / \"Scene in AssetBundle Example\".\n\n//   //\n\n//   //It is also possible to try it in Play mode in the Editor:\n\n//   // - Run the menu at least once to create the scenes and AssetBundle\n\n//   // - Open \"Assets/Scenes/StartingScene.unity\"\n\n//   // - Enter Play modeusing System.IO;\n\n//   using System.Collections;\n\n//   using UnityEngine;\n\n//   using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;#if UNITY_EDITOR\n\n//   using UnityEditor;\n\n//   using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting;\n\n//   using UnityEditor.SceneManagement;\n\n//   #endifpublic class Constants\n\n//   {\n\n//       // Scene in the project that is intended for an AssetBundle\n\n\npublic class AssetBundle {\n    public var isStreamedSceneAssetBundle; // Return true if the AssetBundle contains Unity Scene files\n    public void Contains(); // Check if an AssetBundle contains a specific object.\n    public void GetAllAssetNames(); // Return all Asset names in the AssetBundle.\n    public void GetAllScenePaths(); // Return all the names of Scenes in the AssetBundle.\n    public void LoadAllAssets(); // Loads all Assets contained in the AssetBundle synchronously.\n    public void LoadAllAssetsAsync(); // Loads all Assets contained in the AssetBundle asynchronously.\n    public void LoadAsset(); // Synchronously loads an Asset from the AssetBundle.\n    public void LoadAssetAsync(); // Asynchronously loads an Asset from the bundle.\n    public void LoadAssetWithSubAssets(); // Loads Asset and sub Assets from the AssetBundle synchronously.\n    public void LoadAssetWithSubAssetsAsync(); // Loads Asset and sub Assets from the AssetBundle asynchronously.\n    public void Unload(); // Unloads an AssetBundle freeing its data.\n    public void UnloadAsync(); // Unloads assets in the bundle.\n    public void GetAllLoadedAssetBundles(); // Get an enumeration of all the currently loaded AssetBundles.\n    public void LoadFromFile(); // Synchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.\n    public void LoadFromFileAsync(); // Asynchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.\n    public void LoadFromMemory(); // Synchronously load an AssetBundle from a memory region.\n}",
