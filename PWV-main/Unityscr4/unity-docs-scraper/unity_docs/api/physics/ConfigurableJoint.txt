// Unity Class: ConfigurableJoint
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ConfigurableJoint.html

// Description: The configurable joint is an extremely flexible joint giving you complete control over rotation and linear motion.

// Properties:
// - angularXDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around its local X axis. Only used if Rotation Dr
// - angularXLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the angular X limit of the joint.
// - angularXMotion: Allow rotation around the X axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Low and High
// - angularYLimit: Boundary defining rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.
// - angularYMotion: Allow rotation around the Y axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Angular YLim
// - angularYZDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around its local Y and Z axes. Only used if Rotat
// - angularYZLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the angular Y and angular Z limits of the joint.
// - angularZLimit: Boundary defining rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.
// - angularZMotion: Allow rotation around the Z axis to be Free, completely Locked, or Limited according to Angular ZLim
// - configuredInWorldSpace: If enabled, all Target values will be calculated in world space instead of the object's local space.
// - highAngularXLimit: Boundary defining upper rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.
// - linearLimit: Boundary defining movement restriction, based on distance from the joint's origin.
// - linearLimitSpring: The configuration of the spring attached to the linear limit of the joint.
// - lowAngularXLimit: Boundary defining lower rotation restriction, based on delta from original rotation.
// - projectionAngle: Set the angular tolerance threshold (in degrees) for projection.If the joint deviates by more than t
// - projectionDistance: Set the linear tolerance threshold for projection.If the joint separates by more than this distance 
// - projectionMode: Brings violated constraints back into alignment even when the solver fails. Projection is not a phys
// - rotationDriveMode: Control the object's rotation with either X & YZ or Slerp Drive by itself.
// - secondaryAxis: The joint's secondary axis.
// - slerpDrive: Definition of how the joint's rotation will behave around all local axes. Only used if Rotation Driv
// - swapBodies: Enable this property to swap the order in which the physics engine processes the Rigidbodies involve
// - targetAngularVelocity: This is a Vector3. It defines the desired angular velocity that the joint should rotate into.
// - targetPosition: The desired position that the joint should move into.
// - targetRotation: This is a Quaternion. It defines the desired rotation that the joint should rotate into.
// - targetVelocity: The desired velocity that the joint should move along.

// Methods:
// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any 
// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any 
// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a
// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a
// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor o
// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID: Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString: Returns the name of the object.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the
