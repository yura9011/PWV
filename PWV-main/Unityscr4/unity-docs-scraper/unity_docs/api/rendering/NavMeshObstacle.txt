// Unity Class: NavMeshObstacle
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshObstacle.html

// Description: An obstacle for NavMeshAgents to avoid.

// Properties:
// - carveOnlyStationary: Should this obstacle be carved when it is constantly moving?
// - carving: Should this obstacle make a cut-out in the navmesh.
// - carvingMoveThreshold: Threshold distance for updating a moving carved hole (when carving is enabled).
// - carvingTimeToStationary: Time to wait until obstacle is treated as stationary (when carving and carveOnlyStationary are enabl
// - center: The center of the obstacle, measured in the object's local space.
// - height: Height of the obstacle's cylinder shape.
// - radius: Radius of the obstacle's capsule shape.
// - shape: The shape of the obstacle.
// - size: The size of the obstacle, measured in the object's local space.
// - velocity: Velocity at which the obstacle moves around the NavMesh.

// Methods:
// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any 
// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any 
// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a
// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and a
// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor o
// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
