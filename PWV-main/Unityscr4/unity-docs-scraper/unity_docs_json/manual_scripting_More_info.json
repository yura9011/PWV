With\nscripts\nthat derive from Unity’s built-in\nMonoBehaviour\nclass you can create your own custom Components to control the behavior of\nGameObjects\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n. With scripts that derive from\nScriptableObject\nyou can store large amounts of data efficiently in your application. Alternatively, you can start with an empty C# script to develop your own non-Unity classes.\nUnlike most other assets, scripts are usually created within Unity directly. To create a new script:\nFrom the main menu: go to\nAssets > Create > Scripting\nand select the type of script you want to create.\nOr:\nFrom the Create menu (plus sign) in the\nProject window toolbar\n: go to\nScripting\nand select the type of script you want to create.\nThis creates a new script in whichever folder you have selected in the Project panel. It also selects the script’s file name for editing, prompting you to change the name. For things you should take into account when naming your scripts, refer to\nNaming considerations for scripts\n.\nAdditional resources\nNaming scripts\nMonoBehaviour\nScriptableObject\nIntroduction to programming in Unity\nNaming scripts\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
