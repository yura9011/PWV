// Unity Class: Physics2D
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics2D.html

// Description: Provides utilities and global settings to manage and simulate 2D physics interactions, such as collision detection and raycasting.

// Methods:
// - BoxCast: Casts a box against Colliders in the Scene, returning the first Collider to contact with it.
// - BoxCastAll: Casts a box against Colliders in the Scene, returning all Colliders that contact with it.
// - CapsuleCast: Casts a capsule against Colliders in the Scene, returning the first Collider to contact with it.
// - CapsuleCastAll: Casts a capsule against Colliders in the Scene, returning all Colliders that contact with it.
// - CircleCast: Casts a circle against Colliders in the Scene, returning the first Collider to contact with it.
// - CircleCastAll: Casts a circle against Colliders in the Scene, returning all Colliders that contact with it.
// - ClosestPoint: Returns a point on the perimeter of the Collider that is closest to the specified position.
// - Distance: Calculates the minimum distance between two Colliders.
// - GetContacts: Retrieves all Colliders in contact with the Collider.
// - GetIgnoreCollision: Checks whether the collision detection system will ignore all collisions/triggers between collider1 and collider2 or not.
// - GetIgnoreLayerCollision: Checks whether collisions between the specified layers be ignored or not.
// - GetLayerCollisionMask: Get the collision layer mask that indicates which layer(s) the specified layer can collide with.
// - GetRayIntersection: Cast a 3D ray against the 2D Colliders in the Scene.
// - GetRayIntersectionAll: Cast a 3D ray against the 2D Colliders in the Scene.
// - IgnoreCollision: Makes the collision detection system ignore all collisions/triggers between collider1 and collider2.
// - IgnoreLayerCollision: Choose whether to detect or ignore collisions between a specified pair of layers.
// - IsTouching: Checks whether the passed Colliders are in contact or not.
// - IsTouchingLayers: Checks whether the Collider is touching any Colliders on the specified layerMask or not.
// - Linecast: Casts a line segment against Colliders in the Scene.
// - LinecastAll: Casts a line against Colliders in the Scene.
// - OverlapArea: Checks if a Collider falls within a rectangular area.
// - OverlapAreaAll: Get a list of all Colliders that fall within a rectangular area.
// - OverlapBox: Checks if a Collider falls within a box area.
// - OverlapBoxAll: Get a list of all Colliders that fall within a box area.
// - OverlapCapsule: Checks if a Collider falls within a capsule area.
// - OverlapCapsuleAll: Get a list of all Colliders that fall within a capsule area.
// - OverlapCircle: Checks if a Collider falls within a circular area.
// - OverlapCircleAll: Get a list of all Colliders that fall within a circular area.
// - OverlapCollider: Gets a list of all Colliders that overlap the given Collider.
// - OverlapPoint: Checks if a Collider overlaps a point in space.
// - OverlapPointAll: Get a list of all Colliders that overlap a point in space.
// - Raycast: Casts a ray against Colliders in the Scene.
// - RaycastAll: Casts a ray against Colliders in the Scene, returning all Colliders that contact with it.
// - SetLayerCollisionMask: Set the collision layer mask that indicates which layer(s) the specified layer can collide with.
// - Simulate: Simulate physics in the default physics scene.
// - SyncTransforms: Synchronizes.
