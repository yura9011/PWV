// Unity Class: Touch
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Touch.html

// Description: Structure describing the status of a finger touching the screen.

// Properties:
// - altitudeAngle: Value of 0 radians indicates that the stylus is parallel to the surface, pi/2 indicates that it is perpendicular.
// - azimuthAngle: Value of 0 radians indicates that the stylus is pointed along the x-axis of the device.
// - deltaPosition: The position delta since last change in pixel coordinates.
// - deltaTime: Amount of time that has passed since the last recorded change in Touch values.
// - fingerId: The unique index for the touch.
// - maximumPossiblePressure: The maximum possible pressure value for a platform. If Input.touchPressureSupported returns false, the value of this property will always be 1.0f.
// - phase: Describes the phase of the touch.
// - position: The position of the touch in screen space pixel coordinates.
// - pressure: The current amount of pressure being applied to a touch. 1.0f is considered to be the pressure of an average touch. If Input.touchPressureSupported returns false, the value of this property will always be 1.0f.
// - radius: An estimated value of the radius of a touch. Add radiusVariance to get the maximum touch size, subtract it to get the minimum touch size.
// - radiusVariance: This value determines the accuracy of the touch radius. Add this value to the radius to get the maximum touch size, subtract it to get the minimum touch size.
// - rawPosition: The first position of the touch contact in screen space pixel coordinates.
// - tapCount: Number of taps.
// - type: A value that indicates whether a touch was of Direct, Indirect (or remote), or Stylus type.
