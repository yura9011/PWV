Introduction to 2D
2D game development
You can use the Unity Editor to create projects in 3D and 2D. Read this section to learn how to develop 2D projects in the Editor, including how to use sprites, create Tilemaps, and use the 2D physics system.
Many areas of Unity’s documentation apply to both 2D and 3D development. This section focuses on 2D-specific features and functionality. To choose the right mode for your project, refer to
2D and 3D Projects
. For a comparison on two modes, refer to
