Unity Test Framework integrates a custom version of\nNUnit\n, the open-source unit testing library for .NET languages and extends it with Unity-specific capabilities.\nAs an alternative to\nNUnit tests\n, Unity Test Framework provides\nUnity tests\n, which can interact with Unity-specific concepts such as frames, the application loop, and\ndomain reload\n. A Unity test runs as a\ncoroutine\nin Play mode and in the\nEditorApplication.update\ncallback loop in Edit mode.\nUnity tests can\nyield instructions for the Unity Editor\n. Once the instruction is complete, the test run continues. You can also\nyield return null\nin a Unity test to skip a frame and defer an operation until the next iteration of either the\nEditorApplication.update\nor the\nper-frame game update\nloop.\nThis documentation assumes you’re familiar with NUnit and with fundamental principles of unit testing in C#. If you’re not, refer to\nUnit testing C# with NUnit and .NET Core\nand\nUnit testing best practices\nin the Microsoft documentation.\nNote\n: Unity Test Framework is a\ncore Unity package\nand is distributed as part of a Unity Editor installation. Unity Test Framework currently uses a custom version of NUnit based on version 3.5.\nTopic\nDescription\nGet started with Unity Test Framework\nCreate your first test assembly and sample Unity Test Framework tests.\nCommand-line reference\nRun tests and configure test settings from the Unity Editor command line.\nWriting tests\nWrite Unity tests for Edit mode or Play mode code with the Unity Test Framework C# APIs.\nRunning tests\nRun Unity tests from the Editor’s\nTest Runner\nwindow, from the command line, or directly from code.\nUnity Test Framework learning materials\nFollow a practical tutorial with a series of exercises to help you learn the fundamentals of Unity Test Framework.\nAdditional resources\nQA your code: The new Unity Test Framework (Unite Copenhagen)\nPerformance Testing Package for Unity Test Framework\nTransfromHandle API examples\nGet started with Unity Test Framework\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
