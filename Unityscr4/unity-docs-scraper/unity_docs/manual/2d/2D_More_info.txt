The
Tilemap
A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay.
More info
See in
Glossary
component stores and manages
Tile Assets
for creating 2D levels. It transfers the required information from the tiles placed on it to other related components such as the
Tilemap Renderer
and the
Tilemap Collider 2D
.
The 2D Tilemap Editor package is automatically installed when you create a project with the
2D template
. You can install the 2D Tilemap Editor directly from the Unity registry via the
Package Manager
.
To create, edit, and pick the tiles for
painting onto a tilemap
, refer to the
Tile Palette
(menu:
Window
>
2D
>
Tile Palette
) documentation for more information on its features and tools.
Properties
Property
Description
Animation Frame Rate
Set the frame rate at which tile animations play. Increasing or decreasing this value changes the frame rate of the tile animations. For example, if set to 2, tile animations play at double the base frame rate. If set to 3, tile animations play at triple the base frame rate.
Color
Select a color to apply as a tint to the tiles on this tilemap. Set to white (default color) to have Unity render the tiles without tint.
Tile Anchor
Enter the amount (in cells) along the xyz axes to offset tile anchor positions on the tilemap.
Orientation

XY
Unity orients tiles along the XY plane.
XZ
Unity orients tiles along the XZ plane.
YX
Unity orients tiles along the YX plane.
YZ
Unity orients tiles along the YZ plane.
ZX
Unity orients tiles along the ZX plane.
ZY
Unity orients tiles along the ZY plane.
