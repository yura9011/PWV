To open the Profiler window, go to menu:\nWindow\n>\nAnalysis\n>\nProfiler\n. For information on how to use the Profiler, refer to\nProfiler introduction\nThe Audio Profiler in the Profiler Window\nThe Audio Profiler module’s chart tracks the time spent on the audio in your application. The timings are divided into the following categories:\nChart\nDescription\nPlaying Audio Sources\nTotal number of audio sources playing in the\nscene\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nat the selected frame. This is useful to monitor if the audio is overloaded.\nAudio Voices\nThe number of audio (FMOD channels) voices used in the selected frame.\nTotal Audio CPU\nThe amount of CPU usage the audio used in the selected frame.\nTotal Audio Memory\nThe amount of RAM the audio engine used in the selected frame.\nTo change the order of the categories in the chart, you can drag them in the chart’s legend. You can also click a category’s colored legend to toggle its display.\nModule details pane\nWhen you select the Audio Profiler module, the details pane displays a breakdown of the audio data for the selected frame. There are two views you can use to inspect the audio profiler data:\nSimple\nand\nDetailed\n. To change the display, use the top-left dropdown in the details pane (set to\nSimple\nby default).\nSimple view\nThe\nSimple\nview contains the following information about the audio data for the frame you selected.\nData\nDescription\nTotal Audio Sources\nTotal number of\naudio sources\nA component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nin the scene.\nPlaying Audio Sources\nTotal number of audio sources playing in the scene\nPaused Audio Sources\nThe total number of paused audio sources in the scene.\nAudio Clip Count\nTotal number of\naudio clips\nA container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import .aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m tracker module formats.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nin the scene.\nAudio Voices\nThe total number of audio channels (FMOD channels) your Project uses.\nTotal Audio CPU\nThe total amount of CPU the audio uses.\nDSP CPU\nThe amount of CPU your project uses by mixing,\naudio effects\nAny effect that can modify the output of Audio Mixer components, such as filtering frequency ranges of a sound or applying reverb.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n, and decompression of non-streamed sounds that have the\nCompressed In Memory\nload type. This doesn’t cover the CPU required for sounds that Unity decodes in the background whose load type is\nDecompress On Load\nand have the\nLoad In Background\nflag checked.\nStreaming CPU\nThe amount of CPU your project uses to stream the audio in your application.\nOther CPU\nGeneral CPU overhead not covered by the other CPU categories.\nTotal Audio Memory\nThe amount of memory the audio uses in your project.\nStreaming File Memory\nThe amount of memory that audio files with the load type of\nStreaming\nuse for short-term buffering of compressed audio data when the files are progressively read from disk.\nStreaming Decode Memory\nThe amount of memory that audio files with the load type of\nStreaming\nuse for buffering the decoded sample stream.\nSample Sound Memory\nThe amount of memory that audio files with the load type of\nDecompress On Load\nuse for the decompressed sample data.\nNote:\nUnity pools the memory that the audio system allocates and it keeps growing until it reaches saturation over the runtime of your application. The audio system internally reuses the allocated memory, which can’t be compacted during runtime.\nOther Memory\nOverhead caused by various subsystems in the audio system.\nDetailed view\nThe\nDetailed\nview contains all the information in the\nSimple\nview, and additionally contains detailed per-frame logging of audio events. You can view these either as\nChannels\n,\nGroups\n, or\nChannels and Groups\n. To open this view, open the dropdown at the top of the module details pane, select\nDetailed\n, and then select one of the views from the\ntoolbar\nA row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation).\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nat the top of the pane.\nThe\nGroups\nview shows the hierarchy of the buses in the audio mixer. The\nChannels and Groups\nview displays this information alongside information about the playing sounds.\nThe Audio Profiler Groups view\nThe Audio Profiler Channel and Groups view\nSelect the\nReset play count on play\nto reset the number in the\nPlays\ncolumn the next time you click Play in the Player window, or when you connect to a new target device.\nThe information in the detailed view is arranged into the following columns:\nColumn\nDescription\nObject\nThe\nGameObject\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nthat contains the Audio Source playing the audio.\nAsset\nThe audio Asset that the corresponding GameObject Audio Source is playing.\nVolume\nThe volume the Audio Source applies to the audio. This is a combination of its overall volume property, and the dynamic volume that the distance-dependent attenuation curve applies.\nAudibility\nThe actual level at which the audio plays. This is the sum of the Audio Source’s volume and the other attenuations the mixer channels apply to it.\nPlays\nThe number of times Unity has played the audio. This information is useful to debug logic errors where Unity might not use some audio files.\n3D\nDisplays\nYES\nif the audio uses\ndynamic distance-dependent attenuation\nand directional panning.\nPaused\nDisplays\nYES\nif the audio is paused in this frame.\nMuted\nDisplays\nYES\nif the audio is muted in this frame.\nVirtual\nDisplays\nYES\nif the audio is suspended because of the\nMax Real Voice Count\n, which you can set in the\nAudio Project Settings\n. The\nMax Real Voice Count\nsets the maximum amount of Audio Sources that Unity simultaneously plays at once. If this displays true, Unity has prioritized other audio that has higher audibility or priority in this frame.\nOneShot\nDisplays\nYES\nif\nAudioSource.PlayOneShot()\nplayed the audio.\nLooped\nDisplays\nYES\nif\nAudioSource.Play()\nplayed the audio.\nDistance\nThe distance from the Audio Source to the\nAudioListener\n.\nMinDist\nThe minimum distance defined on the\nAudioSource curve editor\n. This defines a spherical region around the audio where the volume stays at a constant level within it.\nMaxDist\nThe maximum distance defined on the Audio Source curve editor. This defines a spherical region around the audio where the volume stays at a constant level outside of it.\nTime\nThe current relative time in the audio’s playback. While the audio playback is paused, this time does not advance.\nDuration\nThe length of the audio in seconds.\nAdditional resources\nProfiler window introduction\nProfiling your application\nCreate a randomized playlist with the Audio Random Container\nAmbisonic Audio\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
