Unity’s audio system can import most standard audio file formats, play sounds in 3D space, and apply optional effects such as echo and filtering. Unity can also record audio from any available microphone on your machine for use during gameplay or for storage and transmission.\nBasic theory\nIn real life, objects emit sounds that listeners hear. The way a sound is perceived depends on many factors. A listener can tell roughly which direction a sound is coming from and may also get some sense of its distance from its loudness and quality. A fast-moving sound source (such as a falling bomb or a passing police car) changes in pitch as it moves as a result of the Doppler Effect. Surroundings also affect the way sound is reflected. A voice inside a cave has an echo, but the same voice in the open air doesn’t.\nAudio Sources and Listener\nTo simulate the effects of position, Unity requires sounds to originate from Audio Sources attached to objects. The sounds emitted are then picked up by an Audio Listener attached to another object, most often the main\ncamera\nA component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n. Unity can then simulate the effects of a source’s distance and position from the listener object and play them to you accordingly. You can also use the relative speed of the source and listener objects to simulate the Doppler Effect for added realism.\nUnity can’t calculate echoes purely from\nscene\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ngeometry, but you can simulate them by adding\nAudio Filters\nAny audio filter that distorts the sound from an Audio Source or sounds reaching an Audio Listener.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nto objects. For example, you could apply the Echo filter to a sound that is supposed to be coming from inside a cave. In situations where objects can move in and out of a place with a strong echo, you can add a Reverb Zone to the scene. For example, your game might involve cars driving through a tunnel. If you place a reverb zone inside the tunnel, the cars’ engine sounds start to echo as they enter. The echo quiets as the cars emerge from the other side.\nWith the Unity Audio Mixer, you can mix various audio sources, apply effects to them, and perform mastering.\nWorking with audio assets\nUnity can import audio files in\nAIFF\n,\nWAV\n,\nMP3\n, and\nOgg\nformats in the same way as other assets. Drag the files into the Project panel. Import an audio file to create an\nAudio Clip\nA container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import .aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m tracker module formats.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nthat you can then drag to an Audio Source or use from a script. The Audio Clip reference page has more details about the import options available for audio files.\nFor music, Unity also supports tracker modules, which use short audio samples as “instruments” that you can arrange to play tunes. You can import tracker modules from\n.xm\n,\n.mod\n,\n.it\n, and\n.s3m\nfiles and use them the same way you use other audio clips.\nAudio recording\nUnity can access the computer’s microphones from a script and create Audio Clips by direct recording. The Microphone class provides an API to find available microphones, query their capabilities, and start and end a recording session. The script reference page for\nMicrophone\nhas further information and code samples for audio recording.\nAdditional resources\nAudio Source\nA component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nAudio Listener\nA component that acts like a microphone, receiving sound from Audio Sources in the scene and outputting to the computer speakers.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nAudio Mixer\nThe\naudio effects\nAny effect that can modify the output of Audio Mixer components, such as filtering frequency ranges of a sound or applying reverb.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nReverb Zones\nAudio\nAudio files\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
