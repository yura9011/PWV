// Events:
// - clockResyncOccurred: Invoked when the VideoPlayer clock is synced back to its VideoTimeReference.
// - errorReceived: The VideoPlayer uses this callback to report various types of errors.
// - frameDropped: Invoked when the video decoder does not produce a frame as per the time source during playback.
// - frameReady: The VideoPlayer invokes this event when a new frame is ready to be displayed.
// - loopPointReached: The VideoPlayer emits this event when the video reaches the end of its playback.
