Introduction to importing assets
When you create a Unity project, Unity creates a folder for your project which contains an
Assets
subfolder. You can use this folder to store assets created outside of Unity to then use in your project.
Using the Assets folder
You can either export the asset file directly into the
Assets
folder, or copy it into the folder. For many common formats, you can save the source file directly into your project’s
Assets
folder and Unity can read it. Unity also detects when you save new changes to the file and re-imports files as necessary.
For a list of supported asset types, refer to
Supported asset type reference
.
Managing assets in the Project window
Use the
Project window
A window that shows the contents of your
Assets
folder (Project tab)
More info
See in
Glossary
to view the contents of your
Assets
folder. Whenever you save or copy a file to your
Assets
folder, Unity imports it and it then appears in your Project window. If you drag a file from your computer’s file browser into Unity’s Project window, Unity makes a copy and places it into your
Assets
folder. You can then access this copy from the Project window.
Warning:
Usually, the items that appear in your Project window represent actual files on your computer. If you delete them in the Project window, you also delete them from your computer.

Modifying asset files
When you modify a file in Unity, Unity doesn’t modify your original source file. Instead, the import process reads your source file, and creates a representation of your asset internally, which matches your chosen
import settings
. If you modify the import settings for an asset, or make a change to the source file in the
Assets
folder, Unity re-imports the asset again to reflect your changes.
If you want to move or rename assets in your project, it’s best practice to do it in the Project window. Unity then automatically moves or renames the asset’s corresponding
.meta
file. For more information on .meta files, refer to
Asset metadata
.
If you drag a file from your computer’s file browser into Unity’s Project window, Unity makes a copy and places it into your
Assets
folder. You can then access this copy from the Project window.
Complex assets
If you import a single asset file that contains complex information, Unity might create multiple assets from it. For example:
If a 3D file (such as an FBX file) defines materials or contains embedded textures, Unity extracts the
materials and embedded textures
as separate assets.
If you want to import an image file as multiple 2D
sprites
A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.

Glossary
. Use the 2D
Sprite Editor
to define multiple sprites from a single graphic image and Unity displays each sprite as a separate sprite asset in the Project window.
If a 3D file contains multiple animation timelines or multiple clips, Unity automatically defines separate animation timelines or clips based on its
animation import settings
. The resulting multiple animation clips appear as separate
Animation Clip
Animation data that can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”.

assets in the Project window.
Asset processing
Unity reads and processes any files that you add to the
Assets
folder and converts the contents of the file to internal data that’s correctly formatted for your application’s target platform. The source asset files remain unchanged, and Unity stores the internal data in the project’s
Library
folder. This data is part of Unity’s
Asset Database
.
Unity uses internal formats for assets so it can use versions of your assets at runtime in the Unity Editor, and can keep your unmodified source files in the
Assets
folder. This system means that you can edit an asset file and the Editor picks up the changes automatically. For example, hardware such as mobile devices can’t convert
.psd
files directly to render them as textures. When you place a
.psd
file in the
Assets
folder, Unity converts the file to an internal version that mobile devices can process.
Unity stores the internal representation of your assets in the
Library
folder, which behaves like a cache folder. You don’t need to ever alter the
Library
folder manually, and if you do, you might negatively affect your project. This also means that you don’t need to include the
Library
folder under
version control
A system for managing file changes. You can use Unity in conjunction with most common version control tools, including Perforce, Git, Mercurial and PlasticSCM.

.
Tip:
If your project isn’t open, you can safely delete the
Library
folder, because Unity can regenerate all its data from the
Assets
and
ProjectSettings
folders the next time you launch your project.
Asset import settings
Each type of asset that Unity supports has a set of import settings, which affect how the asset appears or behaves. To view an asset’s import settings, select the asset in the Project window. The import settings for the selected asset appear in the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.
More info
See in
Glossary
. The options that appear vary depending on the type of asset selected.

For more information, refer to the documentation on the following Import Settings:

SketchUp Import Settings
SpeedTree Import Settings
Texture Import Settings
Cubemap texture Import Settings
Animation Import Settings
Assembly Definition Import Settings
Audio Import Settings
If you’re developing a cross-platform project, you can override the default settings and assign different import settings on a per-platform basis.
Reusing assets between projects
As you build your application,
Unity stores metadata
about your assets, such as import settings and links to other assets, among other information. If you want to transfer your assets into a different project and preserve all this information, you can export your assets into one of the following containers:
An
asset package
A collection of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored in one file, similar to Zip files, with the
.unitypackage
extension. Asset packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and collections of assets.

, which you can create directly in the Editor.
A
custom package
, which you can access and manage inside the
Package Manager
.
