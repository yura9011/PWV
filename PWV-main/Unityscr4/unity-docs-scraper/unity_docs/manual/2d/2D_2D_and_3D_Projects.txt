2D and 3D projects
Unity is equally suited to creating both 2D and 3D games. When you create a new project, you choose either 2D or 3D mode. You may already know what you want to build, but there are a few subtle points that may affect which mode you choose.
The choice between starting in 2D or 3D mode determines some settings for the Unity Editor, such as whether images are imported as textures or
sprites
A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.

. You can swap between 2D or 3D mode at any time regardless of the mode you set when you created your project (see
2D and 3D Mode Settings
). Here are some guidelines which should help you choose.

Some 3D scenes from Unity’s sample projects on the Asset Store
3D games usually make use of three-dimensional geometry, with Materials and Textures rendered on the surface of
GameObjects
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.

to make them appear as solid environments, characters and objects that make up your game world. The Camera can move in and around the
Scene
A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

freely, with light and shadows cast around the world in a realistic way. 3D games usually render the Scene using perspective, so objects appear larger on screen as they get closer to the camera. For all games that fit this description, start in
3D
mode.
Orthographic 3D
Some 3D games using an Orthographic view. Images created using assets from
Synty Studios
and
BITGEM
Sometimes games use 3D geometry, but use an orthographic camera instead of perspective. This is a common technique used in games which give you a bird’s-eye view of the action, and is sometimes called “2.5D”. If you’re making a game like this, you should also use the Editor in
3D
mode, because even though there is no
perspective
, you will still be working with 3D models and Assets. You’ll need to switch your
Camera
A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture.

and
Scene view
An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object.

Some examples of typical 2D game types
Many 2D games use flat graphics, sometimes called sprites, which have no three-dimensional geometry at all. They are drawn to the screen as flat images, and the game’s camera has no perspective. For this type of game, you should start the editor in
2D
mode.
2D gameplay with 3D graphics
A side scrolling game with 2D gameplay, but 3d graphics
Some 2D games use 3D geometry for the environment and characters, but restrict the
gameplay
to two dimensions. For example, the camera may show a side-scrolling view, and the player can only move in two dimensions, but the game itself still uses 3D models for the obstacles and a 3D perspective for the camera. For these games, the 3D effect may serve a stylistic rather than functional purpose. This type of game is
also
sometimes referred to as “2.5D”. Although the gameplay is 2D, you are mostly manipulating 3D models to build the game, so you should start the editor in
3D
mode.
2D gameplay and graphics with a perspective camera
A 2D “cardboard theatre” style game, giving a parallax movement effect. Image created using an asset by
One Point Six Studio
, available on the Unity Asset Store.
This is another popular style of 2D game, using 2D graphics but with a perspective camera to get a parallax scrolling effect. This is a “cardboard theater”-style scene, where all graphics are flat, but arranged at different distances from the camera. It’s most likely that
2D
mode will suit your development in this case. However, you should change your
Camera’s
projection mode to
Perspective
and the
Scene view
mode to
3D
.

XR
An umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices.
