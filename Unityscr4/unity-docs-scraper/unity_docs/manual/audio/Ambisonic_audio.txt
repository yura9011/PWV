Develop an ambisonic audio decoder
Ambisonic Audio
Ambisonics are a type of audio that provide a representation of sound that can completely surround a listener. They can provide an audio
skybox
A special type of Material used to represent skies. Usually six-sided.

for distant ambient sounds, and are particularly useful for 360-degree videos and applications.
Ambisonics are stored in a multi-channel format. Instead of mapping each channel to a specific speaker, ambisonics represent the soundfield in a more general way. You can rotate the soundfield based on the listener’s orientation (such as the user’s head rotation in VR). You can also decode the soundfield into a format that matches the speaker setup.
Selecting an ambisonic audio decoder
To select an ambisonic audio decoder in your project, open your project’s
Audio
settings (menu:
Edit
>
Project Settings
>
Audio
). Select an
Ambisonic Decoder Plugin
from the list of available decoders in the project.
Ambisonic options in the Audio settings
There are no built-in decoders included with Unity, but you can do one of the following options:
You can create your own ambisonic audio decoder
plug-in
A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).

Importing an ambisonic audio clip
To import an ambisonic
audio clip
A container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import .aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m tracker module formats.

Playing the ambisonic audio clip through an Audio Source
To play an ambisonic audio clip through an
Audio Source
A component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer.

Glossary
:
Assign the WAV file as an
Audio Clip
on an Audio Source.
Disable the
Spatialize
option. When you play an ambisonic audio clip, it is automatically decoded through the project’s selected ambisonic audio decoder. The decoder converts the clip from ambisonic format to the project’s selected speaker format. It also already handles spatialization as a part of this decoding operation, based on the orientation of the audio source and
audio listener
A component that acts like a microphone, receiving sound from Audio Sources in the scene and outputting to the computer speakers.

Glossary
.
When Unity plays an ambisonic audio clip, it decompresses the file, if necessary, then decodes it to convert it to the project’s selected speaker mode. It then applies the Audio Source’s effects.
Note:
Reverb zones are disabled for ambisonic audio clips.
