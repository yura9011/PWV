// Unity Class: RaycastHit2D
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RaycastHit2D.html

// Description: Returns information about 2D Colliders detected by a 2D physics query in the scene.

// Properties:
// - centroid: The world space centroid (center) of the physics query shape when it intersects.
// - collider: The Collider2D detected by the physics query.
// - distance: The distance the physics query traversed before it detected a Collider2D.
// - fraction: The fraction of the distance specified to the physics query before it detected a Collider2D.
// - normal: The surface normal of the detected Collider2D.
// - point: The world space position where the physics query shape intersected with the detected Collider2D surface.
// - rigidbody: The Rigidbody2D that the Collider2D detected by the physics query is attached to.
// - transform: The Transform on the GameObject that the Collider2D is attached to.
