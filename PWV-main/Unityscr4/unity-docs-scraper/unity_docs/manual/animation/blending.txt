Animation Blend Trees
A common task in game animation is to blend between two or more similar motions. Perhaps the best known example is the blending of walking and running animations according to the character’s speed. Another example is a character leaning to the left or right as it turns during a run.
It is important to distinguish between Transitions and Blend Trees. While both are used for creating smooth animation, they are used for different kinds of situations.
Use
Transitions
The blend from one state to another in a state machine, such as transitioning a character from a walk to a jog animation. Transitions define how long the blend between states should take, and the conditions that activate the blend.

Glossary
to smoothly transition from one Animation State to another over a given amount of time. Transitions are specified as part of an
Animation State Machine
A graph within an Animator Controller that controls the interaction of Animation States. Each state references an Animation Blend Tree or a single Animation Clip.

. A transition from one motion to a completely different motion is usually fine if the transition is quick.
Use
Blend Trees
to smoothly blend multiple animations by incorporating parts of each animation, at varying degrees. The amount that each of the motions contributes to the final effect is controlled using a blending parameter, which is just one of the numeric
animation parameters
Used to communicate between scripting and the Animator Controller. Some parameters can be set in scripting and used by the controller, while other parameters are based on Custom Curves in Animation Clips and can be sampled using the scripting API.

associated with the
Animator Controller
Controls animation through Animation Layers with Animation State Machines and Animation Blend Trees, controlled by Animation Parameters. The same Animator Controller can be referenced by multiple models with Animator components.

. In order for the blended motion to make sense, the motions that are blended must be of similar nature and timing. Blend Trees are a special type of state in an Animation
State Machine
The set of states in an Animator Controller that a character or animated GameObject can be in, along with a set of transitions between those states and a variable to remember the current state. The states available will depend on the type of gameplay, but typical states include things like idling, walking, running and jumping.

.
Examples of similar motions could be various walk and run animations. In order for the blend to work well, the movements in the clips must take place at the same points in normalized time. For example, walking and running animations can be aligned so that the moments of contact of foot to the floor take place at the same points in normalized time (e.g. the left foot hits at 0.0 and the right foot at 0.5). Since normalized time is used, it doesn’t matter if the clips are of different length.
Using Blend Trees
To start working with a new Blend Tree, do the following:
Right-click on empty space on the Animator Controller Window.
Select
Create State
>
From New Blend Tree
from the context menu.
Double-click the Blend Tree to enter the Blend Tree Graph.
The
Animator Window
The window where the Animator Controller is visualized and edited.

Glossary
displays a graph of the entire Blend Tree while the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.

Glossary
shows the currently selected node and its immediate children, if applicable.
For example, the Blend Tree on the left displays only the root Blend Node because it does not have child nodes. The Blend Tree on the right has a root with three Animation Clips as child nodes.
To add
animation clips
Animation data that can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”.

to the blend tree you can select the blend tree, then click the plus icon in the motion field in the inspector.

You can also right-click and use the context menu to add animation clips or child
blend nodes

When the blend tree has Animation clips and input parameters, the Inspector window displays a graphical representation of how the animations are combined. Use the slider
This visualization changes as the parameter value changes (as you drag the slider, the arrows from the tree root change their shading to show the dominant animation clip).
A 2D Blend Tree with five animation clips
Select any of the nodes in the Blend Tree graph to display it in the Inspector window. If the selected node is an Animation Clip, the Inspector for that Animation Clip will be shown. The settings will be read-only if the animation is imported from a model. If the node is a Blend Node, the Inspector for Blend Nodes will be shown.
Select either 1D or 2D blending from the
Blend Type
menu. The following topics provide more details on these blend types and the settings available in the Inspector window:
