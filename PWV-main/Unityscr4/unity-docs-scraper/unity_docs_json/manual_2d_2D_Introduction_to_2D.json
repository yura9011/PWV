This page introduces the gameplay, graphics, and physics specific to 2D Unity projects.\nGameplay in 2D\nThe familiar functions of the Unity Editor when you use 3D mode are still available but with helpful additions to simplify 2D development.\nScene viewed in 2D mode\nThe most noticeable feature is the\n2D\nview mode button in the\ntoolbar\nA row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation).\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nof the\nScene\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nview. When you enable 2D mode, Unity will set an orthographic (perspective-free) view. This view means that the\ncamera\nA component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nlooks along the z-axis with the y-axis increasing upwards, which enables you to visualize the scene and easily place\n2D objects\nA 2D GameObject such as a tilemap or sprite.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n.\nFor a full list of 2D components, how to change between 2D and 3D mode, and the different 2D and 3D mode settings, refer to\n2D or 3D Projects\n.\n2D graphics\nGraphic objects in 2D are known as\nSprites\n. Sprites are standard textures, with special techniques for combining and managing\nsprite\nA 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ntextures for efficiency and convenience during development. Unity provides a built-in\nSprite Editor\nto let you extract sprite graphics from a larger image. This enables you to edit many component images within a single texture in your image editor. You can use this, for example, to keep the arms, legs, and body of a character as separate elements within one image.\nSprites are rendered with a\nSprite Renderer\nA component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ncomponent rather than the\nMesh Renderer\nA mesh component that takes the geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the object’s Transform component.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nused with 3D objects. You can add this to a GameObject via the Components menu (\nComponent\n>\nRendering\n>\nSprite Renderer\n) or you can create a GameObject directly with a Sprite Renderer already attached (menu:\nGameObject\n>\n2D Object\n>\nSprite\n).\nYou can also use a\nSprite Creator\ntool to make placeholder 2D images.\n2D physics\nUnity has a separate physics system to handle 2D physics so you can make use of optimizations only available with 2D. The components correspond to the standard 3D physics components such as\nRigidbody\nA component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n,\nBox Collider\nA cube-shaped collider component that handles collisions for GameObjects like dice and ice cubes.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n, and\nHinge Joint\nA joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n, but with\n2D\nappended to the name. Therefore, you can equip sprites with\nRigidbody 2D\n,\nBox Collider 2D\n, and\nHinge Joint 2D\n. Most 2D physics components are flattened versions of the 3D equivalents (for example,\nBox Collider 2D\nis a square while\nBox Collider\nis a cube) but there are a few exceptions.\nFor the full list of 2D physics components, refer to\n2D or 3D Projects\n. For further information about 2D physics concepts and components, refer to the\nPhysics\nsection of the manual. To specify 2D physics settings, refer to the\nPhysics 2D\nwindow.\n2D game development\nGet started with 2D game development\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies. All rights reserved.
