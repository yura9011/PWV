Creating scripts
Scripts allow you to customize and extend the capabilities of your applicaton with C# code. With
scripts
that derive from Unity’s built-in
MonoBehaviour
class you can create your own custom Components to control the behavior of
GameObjects
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.

. With scripts that derive from
ScriptableObject
you can store large amounts of data efficiently in your application. Alternatively, you can start with an empty C# script to develop your own non-Unity classes.
Unlike most other assets, scripts are usually created within Unity directly. To create a new script:
From the main menu: go to
Assets > Create > Scripting
and select the type of script you want to create.
Or:
From the Create menu (plus sign) in the
Project window toolbar
: go to
Scripting
and select the type of script you want to create.
This creates a new script in whichever folder you have selected in the Project panel. It also selects the script’s file name for editing, prompting you to change the name. For things you should take into account when naming your scripts, refer to
Naming considerations for scripts
.
