Audio Profiler module reference
The Audio Profiler module monitors the performance of the audio system in your application, such as the total load and voice counts. To open the Profiler window, go to menu:
Window
>
Analysis
>
Profiler
. For information on how to use the Profiler, refer to
Profiler introduction
The Audio Profiler in the Profiler Window
The Audio Profiler module’s chart tracks the time spent on the audio in your application. The timings are divided into the following categories:
Chart
Description
Playing Audio Sources
Total number of audio sources playing in the
scene
A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

See in
Glossary
at the selected frame. This is useful to monitor if the audio is overloaded.
Audio Voices
The number of audio (FMOD channels) voices used in the selected frame.
Total Audio CPU
The amount of CPU usage the audio used in the selected frame.
Total Audio Memory
The amount of RAM the audio engine used in the selected frame.
To change the order of the categories in the chart, you can drag them in the chart’s legend. You can also click a category’s colored legend to toggle its display.
Module details pane
When you select the Audio Profiler module, the details pane displays a breakdown of the audio data for the selected frame. There are two views you can use to inspect the audio profiler data:
Simple
and
Detailed
. To change the display, use the top-left dropdown in the details pane (set to
Simple
by default).
Simple view
The
Simple
view contains the following information about the audio data for the frame you selected.
Data
Description
Total Audio Sources
Total number of
audio sources
A component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer.
More info
See in
Glossary
in the scene.
Playing Audio Sources
Total number of audio sources playing in the scene
Paused Audio Sources
The total number of paused audio sources in the scene.
Audio Clip Count
Total number of
audio clips
A container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import .aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m tracker module formats.
More info
See in
Glossary
in the scene.
Audio Voices
The total number of audio channels (FMOD channels) your Project uses.
Total Audio CPU
The total amount of CPU the audio uses.
DSP CPU
The amount of CPU your project uses by mixing,
audio effects
Any effect that can modify the output of Audio Mixer components, such as filtering frequency ranges of a sound or applying reverb.

Glossary
, and decompression of non-streamed sounds that have the
Compressed In Memory
load type. This doesn’t cover the CPU required for sounds that Unity decodes in the background whose load type is
Decompress On Load
and have the
Load In Background
flag checked.
Streaming CPU
The amount of CPU your project uses to stream the audio in your application.
Other CPU
General CPU overhead not covered by the other CPU categories.
Total Audio Memory
The amount of memory the audio uses in your project.
Streaming File Memory
The amount of memory that audio files with the load type of
Streaming
use for short-term buffering of compressed audio data when the files are progressively read from disk.
Streaming Decode Memory
The amount of memory that audio files with the load type of
Streaming
use for buffering the decoded sample stream.
Sample Sound Memory
The amount of memory that audio files with the load type of
Decompress On Load
use for the decompressed sample data.
Note:
Unity pools the memory that the audio system allocates and it keeps growing until it reaches saturation over the runtime of your application. The audio system internally reuses the allocated memory, which can’t be compacted during runtime.
Other Memory
Overhead caused by various subsystems in the audio system.
Detailed view
The
Detailed
view contains all the information in the
Simple
view, and additionally contains detailed per-frame logging of audio events. You can view these either as
Channels
,
Groups
, or
Channels and Groups
. To open this view, open the dropdown at the top of the module details pane, select
Detailed
, and then select one of the views from the
toolbar
A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation).
More info
See in
Glossary
at the top of the pane.
The
Groups
view shows the hierarchy of the buses in the audio mixer. The
Channels and Groups
view displays this information alongside information about the playing sounds.
The Audio Profiler Groups view
The Audio Profiler Channel and Groups view
Select the
Reset play count on play
to reset the number in the
Plays
column the next time you click Play in the Player window, or when you connect to a new target device.
The information in the detailed view is arranged into the following columns:
Column
Description
Object
The
GameObject
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.

that contains the Audio Source playing the audio.
Asset
The audio Asset that the corresponding GameObject Audio Source is playing.
Volume
The volume the Audio Source applies to the audio. This is a combination of its overall volume property, and the dynamic volume that the distance-dependent attenuation curve applies.
Audibility
The actual level at which the audio plays. This is the sum of the Audio Source’s volume and the other attenuations the mixer channels apply to it.
Plays
The number of times Unity has played the audio. This information is useful to debug logic errors where Unity might not use some audio files.
3D
Displays
YES
if the audio uses
dynamic distance-dependent attenuation
and directional panning.
Paused
Displays
YES
if the audio is paused in this frame.
Muted
Displays
YES
if the audio is muted in this frame.
Virtual
Displays
YES
if the audio is suspended because of the
Max Real Voice Count
, which you can set in the
Audio Project Settings
. The
Max Real Voice Count
sets the maximum amount of Audio Sources that Unity simultaneously plays at once. If this displays true, Unity has prioritized other audio that has higher audibility or priority in this frame.
OneShot
Displays
YES
if
AudioSource.PlayOneShot()
played the audio.
Looped
Displays
YES
if
AudioSource.Play()
played the audio.
Distance
The distance from the Audio Source to the
AudioListener
.
MinDist
The minimum distance defined on the
AudioSource curve editor
. This defines a spherical region around the audio where the volume stays at a constant level within it.
MaxDist
The maximum distance defined on the Audio Source curve editor. This defines a spherical region around the audio where the volume stays at a constant level outside of it.
Time
The current relative time in the audio’s playback. While the audio playback is paused, this time does not advance.
Duration
The length of the audio in seconds.
