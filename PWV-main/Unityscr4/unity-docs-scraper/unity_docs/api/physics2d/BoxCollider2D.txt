// Unity Class: BoxCollider2D
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BoxCollider2D.html

// Description: Collider for 2D physics representing an axis-aligned rectangle.

// Properties:
// - autoTiling: Determines whether the BoxCollider2D's shape is automatically updated based on a SpriteRenderer's tiling properties.
// - edgeRadius: Controls the radius of all edges created by the collider.
// - size: The width and height of the rectangle.

// Methods:
// - CanContact: This method determines if both Colliders can ever come into contact.
// - Cast: Casts the Collider shape into the Scene starting at the Collider position ignoring the Collider itself.
// - ClosestPoint: Returns a point on the perimeter of this Collider that is closest to the specified position.
// - CreateMesh: Creates a planar Mesh that is identical to the area defined by the Collider2D geometry.
// - Distance: Calculates the minimum separation of this collider against another collider.
// - GetContacts: Retrieves all contact points for this Collider.
// - GetShapeBounds: Retrieves a list of Bounds for all PhysicsShape2D created by this Collider2D, and returns the combined Bounds of the retrieved list.
// - GetShapeHash: Generates a simple hash value based upon the geometry of the Collider2D.
// - GetShapes: Gets all the PhysicsShape2D used by the Collider2D.
// - IsTouching: Check whether this collider is touching the collider or not.
// - IsTouchingLayers: Checks whether this collider is touching any colliders on the specified layerMask or not.
// - Overlap: Get a list of all Colliders that overlap this Collider.
// - OverlapPoint: Check if a collider overlaps a point in space.
// - Raycast: Casts a ray into the Scene that starts at the Collider position and ignores the Collider itself.
// - BroadcastMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag: Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentIndex: Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent: Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.
// - GetComponents: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentsInParent: Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.
// - SendMessage: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards: Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.
// - TryGetComponent: Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID: Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString: Returns the name of the object.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the AsyncInstantiateOperation.
