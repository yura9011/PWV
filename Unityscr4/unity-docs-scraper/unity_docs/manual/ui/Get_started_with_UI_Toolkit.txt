Introduction to UI Toolkit
UI Builder
Get started with UI Toolkit
Want to create your first UI with UI Toolkit? Use this basic UI Toolkit workflow example to get started.
Note
: For demonstration purposes, this guide describes how to add UI controls for the Editor UI. However, the instructions on adding UI controls to a UI Document also apply to runtime UI. For more information, refer to
Get started with runtime UI
.
If you perform a specific task often, you can use UI Toolkit to create a dedicated UI for it. For example, you can create a custom Editor window. The example demonstrates how to create a custom Editor window and add UI controls into your custom Editor window with
UI Builder
,
UXML
, and C# script.
You can find the completed files that this example creates in this
GitHub repository
.
Create a custom Editor window
Create a custom Editor window with two labels.
Create a project in Unity Editor with any template.
In the
Project
window, right-click in the
Assets
folder, and then select
Create
>
UI Toolkit
>
Editor Window
.
In
UI Toolkit Editor Window Creator
, enter
SimpleCustomEditor
in the
C
# box.
Keep the
UXML
checkbox selected and clear the
USS
checkbox.
Select
Confirm
.
To open the Editor window, select
Window
>
UI Toolkit
>
SimpleCustomEditor
.
You can find the source files for it in the
Assets/Editor
folder.
Add UI controls to the window
You can add UI controls to your window in the following ways:
Use the UI Builder to visually add the UI controls
Use an XML-like text file (UXML) to add the UI controls
Use C# script to add the UI controls
You can use any of these methods individually, or combine. The following examples create three sets of labels, buttons, and toggles with a combination of these methods.
Use UI Builder to add UI controls
To visually add UI controls to your window, use
UI Builder
. The following steps add a button and a toggle into your custom Editor window in addition to the default label.
In the
Editor
folder, double-click
SimpleCustomEditor.uxml
to open the UI Builder.
In the UI Builder, drag
Button
and
Toggle
from
Library
>
Controls
into the
Hierarchy
or the window preview in the
Viewport
.
In the
Hierarchy
window, select
Label
.
In the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.

window, change the default text to
These controls were created in UI Builder
in the
Text
field.
In the
Hierarchy
window, select
Button
.
In the
Inspector
window, enter
This is button1
in the
Text
field.
Enter
button1
in the
Name
field.
In the
Hierarchy
window, select
Toggle
.
In the
Inspector
window, enter
Number?
in the
Label
field.
Enter
toggle1
in the
Name
field.
Save
and close the UI Builder window.
Close your custom Editor window if you haven’t done so.
In the
Project
window, select
SimpleCustomEditor.cs
and make sure the
Visual Tree Asset
is set to
SimpleCustomEditor (Visual Tree Asset)
in the
Inspector
window.
Select
Window
>
UI Toolkit
>
SimpleCustomEditor
to re-open your custom Editor window to see the button and the toggle you just added.
Custom Editor Window with one set UI Controls
Use UXML to add UI controls
If you prefer to define your UI in a text file, you can edit the
UXML
to add the UI controls. The following steps add another set of label, button, and toggle into your window.
In the
Editor
folder, select
Assets
>
Create
>
UI Toolkit
>
UI Document
to create a UXML file called
SimpleCustomEditor_UXML.uxml
.
Select the arrow on
SimpleCustomEditor_UXML.uxml
in the
Project
window.
Double-click
inlineStyle
to open
SimpleCustomEditor_UXML.uxml
in a text editor.
Replace the contents of
SimpleCustomEditor_uxml.uxml
with the following:
<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:uie="UnityEditor.UIElements" xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" engine="UnityEngine.UIElements" editor="UnityEditor.UIElements" noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../UIElementsSchema/UIElements.xsd" editor-extension-mode="False">
 <ui:Label text="These controls were created with UXML." />
 <ui:Button text="This is button2" name="button2"/>
 <ui:Toggle label="Number?" name="toggle2"/>
 </ui:UXML>
Open
SimpleCustomEditor.cs
.
Import the UXML file you created manually by adding the following to the
CreateGUI
method:
// Import UXML created manually.
var visualTree = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<VisualTreeAsset>("Assets/Editor/SimpleCustomEditor_uxml.uxml");
VisualElement labelFromUXML = visualTree.Instantiate();
root.Add(labelFromUXML);
Save your changes.
Select
Window
>
UI Toolkit
>
SimpleCustomEditor
. This opens your custom Editor window with three labels, two buttons, and two toggles.
Custom Editor Window with two sets UI Controls
Use C# script to add UI controls
If you prefer coding, you can add UI Controls to your window with a C# script. The following steps add another set of label, button, and toggle into your window.
Open
SimpleCustomEditor.cs
.
Unity uses
UnityEngine.UIElements
for basic UI controls like label, button, and toggle. To work with UI controls, you must add the following declaration if it’s not already present.
using UnityEngine.UIElements;
Change the text of the existing label from
"Hello World! From C#"
to
"These controls were created using C# code."
.
The
EditorWindow
class has a property called
rootVisualElement
. To add the UI controls to your window, first instantiate the element class with some attributes, and then use the
Add
methods of the
rootVisualElement
.
Your finished
CreateGUI()
method looks like the following:
public void CreateGUI()
{
 // Each editor window contains a root VisualElement object
 VisualElement root = rootVisualElement;

 // VisualElements objects can contain other VisualElements following a tree hierarchy.
 Label label = new Label("These controls were created using C# code.");
 root.Add(label);

 Button button = new Button();
 button.name = "button3";
 button.text = "This is button3.";
 root.Add(button);

 Toggle toggle = new Toggle();
 toggle.name = "toggle3";
 toggle.label = "Number?";
 root.Add(toggle);

 // Instantiate UXML created automatically which is set as the default VisualTreeAsset.
 root.Add(m_VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate());

 // Import UXML created manually.
 var visualTree = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<VisualTreeAsset>("Assets/Editor/SimpleCustomEditor_uxml.uxml");
 VisualElement labelFromUXML = visualTree.Instantiate();
 root.Add(labelFromUXML);
}
Select
Window
>
UI Toolkit
>
SimpleCustomEditor
to open your custom Editor window to see three labels, three buttons, and three toggles.
Custom Editor Window with three Controls
Define the behavior of your UI controls
You can set up event handlers for your UI controls so that when you click the button, and select or clear the toggle, your UI controls perform some tasks.
In this example, set up event handlers that:
When a button is clicked, the Editor Console displays a message.
When a toggle is selected, the Console shows how many times the buttons have been clicked.
Your finished
SimpleCustomEditor.cs
looks like the following:
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UIElements;

public class SimpleCustomEditor : EditorWindow
{
 [SerializeField]
 private VisualTreeAsset m_VisualTreeAsset = default;

 [MenuItem("Window/UI Toolkit/SimpleCustomEditor")]
 public static void ShowExample()
 {
 SimpleCustomEditor wnd = GetWindow<SimpleCustomEditor>();
 wnd.titleContent = new GUIContent("SimpleCustomEditor");
 }

 private int m_ClickCount = 0;

 private const string m_ButtonPrefix = "button";

 public void CreateGUI()
 {
 // Each editor window contains a root VisualElement object
 VisualElement root = rootVisualElement;

 // VisualElements objects can contain other VisualElement following a tree hierarchy.
 Label label = new Label("These controls were created using C# code.");
 root.Add(label);

 Button button = new Button();
 button.name = "button3";
 button.text = "This is button3.";
 root.Add(button);

 Toggle toggle = new Toggle();
 toggle.name = "toggle3";
 toggle.label = "Number?";
 root.Add(toggle);

 // Instantiate UXML created automatically which is set as the default VisualTreeAsset.
 root.Add(m_VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate());

 // Import UXML created manually.
 var visualTree = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<VisualTreeAsset>("Assets/Editor/SimpleCustomEditor_uxml.uxml");
 VisualElement labelFromUXML = visualTree.Instantiate();
 root.Add(labelFromUXML);

 //Call the event handler
 SetupButtonHandler();
 }

 //Functions as the event handlers for your button click and number counts
 private void SetupButtonHandler()
 {
 VisualElement root = rootVisualElement;

 var buttons = root.Query<Button>();
 buttons.ForEach(RegisterHandler);
 }

 private void RegisterHandler(Button button)
 {
 button.RegisterCallback<ClickEvent>(PrintClickMessage);
 }

 private void PrintClickMessage(ClickEvent evt)
 {
 VisualElement root = rootVisualElement;

 ++m_ClickCount;

 //Because of the names we gave the buttons and toggles, we can use the
 //button name to find the toggle name.
 Button button = evt.currentTarget as Button;
 string buttonNumber = button.name.Substring(m_ButtonPrefix.Length);
 string toggleName = "toggle" + buttonNumber;
 Toggle toggle = root.Q<Toggle>(toggleName);

 Debug.Log("Button was clicked!" +
 (toggle.value ? " Count: " + m_ClickCount : ""));
 }
}
