It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nin the\nAnimation tab\n.\nYou can use these curves to add additional animated data to an imported clip. You can use that data to animate the timings of other items based on the state of an animator. For example, in a game set in icy conditions, an extra animation curve could be used to control the emission rate of a\nparticle\nA small, simple image or mesh that is emitted by a particle system. A particle system can display and move particles in great numbers to represent a fluid or amorphous entity. The effect of all the particles together creates the impression of the complete entity, such as smoke.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nsystem to show the player’s condensing breath in the cold air.\nTo add a curve to an imported animation, expand the\nCurves\nsection at the bottom of the\nAnimation tab\n, and click the plus icon to add a new curve to the current animation clip:\nThe expanded Curves section on the Animation tab\nIf your imported animation file is split into multiple animation clips, each clip can have its own custom curves.\nThe curves on an imported animation clip\nThe curve’s X-axis represents\nnormalized time\nand always ranges between 0.0 and 1.0 (corresponding to the beginning and the end of the animation clip respectively, regardless of its duration).\nUnity Curve Editor\n(A)\nWrapping mode\n(B)\nCurve Presets\nDouble-clicking an animation curve brings up the\nstandard Unity curve editor\nwhich you can use to add\nkeys\nto the curve. Keys are points along the curve’s timeline where it has a value explicitly set by the animator rather than just using an interpolated value. Keys are very useful for marking important points along the timeline of the animation. For example, with a walking animation, you might use keys to mark the points where the left foot is on the ground, then both feet on the ground, right foot on the ground, and so on. Once the keys are set up, you can move conveniently between key frames by pressing the\nPrevious Key Frame\nand\nNext Key Frame\nbuttons. This moves the vertical red line and shows the\nnormalized time\nat the\nkeyframe\nA frame that marks the start or end point of a transition in an animation. Frames in between the keyframes are called inbetweens.\nSee in\nGlossary\n. The value you enter in the text box drives the value of the curve at that time.\nAnimation curves and animator controller parameters\nIf you have a curve with the same name as one of the\nparameters\nin the\nAnimator Controller\nControls animation through Animation Layers with Animation State Machines and Animation Blend Trees, controlled by Animation Parameters. The same Animator Controller can be referenced by multiple models with Animator components.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n, then that parameter takes its value from the value of the curve at each point in the timeline. For example, if you make a call to\nGetFloat\nfrom a script, the returned value is equal to the value of the curve at the time the call is made. Note that at any given point in time, there might be multiple animation clips attempting to set the same parameter from the same controller. In that case, Unity blends the curve values from the multiple animation clips. If an animation has no curve for a particular parameter, then Unity blends with the default value for that parameter.\nLoop optimization on Animation clips\nEvents\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
