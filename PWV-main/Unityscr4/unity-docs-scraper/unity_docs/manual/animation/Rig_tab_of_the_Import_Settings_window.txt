Rig tab
The settings on the
Rig
tab define how Unity maps the deformers to the
mesh
The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons.

Glossary
in the imported model so that you can animate it. For humanoid characters, this means
assigning or creating an avatar
. For non-humanoid (generic) characters, this means
identifying a root bone in the skeleton
.
To open the Rig tab, select a mesh, and in the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.
More info
See in
Glossary
select the
Rig
tab.
Animation Type
The value you select for the
Animation Type
determines the layout for the
Rig
tab.
By default, when you select a model in the
Project
In Unity, you use a project to design and develop a game. A project stores all of the files that are related to a game, such as the asset and Scene files.

See in
Glossary
view, Unity determines which
Animation Type
best matches the selected model and displays it in the
Rig
tab. If Unity has never imported the file, the Animation Type is set to
None
.
Property
Description
None
No animation present.
Legacy
Use the
Legacy Animation System
. Import and use animations as with Unity version 3.x and earlier.
Generic
Use the
Generic Animation System
if your rig is non-humanoid (quadruped or any entity to be animated). Unity picks a root node automatically but you can identify another bone to use as the
Root node
A transform in an animation hierarchy that allows Unity to establish consistency between Animation clips for a generic model. It also enables Unity to properly blend between Animations that have not been authored “in place” (that is, where the whole Model moves its world position while animating).
More info
See in
Glossary
instead.
Humanoid
Use the
Humanoid Animation System
if your rig is humanoid (it has two legs, two arms and a head). Unity usually detects the skeleton and maps it to the Avatar correctly. In some cases, you may need to set the
Avatar Definition
and configure the mapping manually.
Generic animation types
Generic Animations
do not use Avatars like
Humanoid animations
An animation using humanoid skeletons. Humanoid models generally have the same basic structure, representing the major articulate parts of the body, head and limbs. This makes it easy to map animations from one humanoid skeleton to another, allowing retargeting and inverse kinematics.

See in
Glossary
do. Since the skeleton can be arbitrary, you must specify which bone is the
Root node
. The Root node allows Unity to establish consistency between
Animation clips
Animation data that can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”.
More info
See in
Glossary
for a generic model, and blend properly between Animations that have not been authored “in place” (that is, where the whole model moves its world position while animating).
Specifying the root node helps Unity determine between movement of the bones relative to each other, and motion of the Root node in the world (controlled from
OnAnimatorMove
).
Property
Description
Avatar Definition
Choose where to get the Avatar definition. The following options are available:
Create from this model
- Create an Avatar based on this model
Copy from Other Avatar
- Point to an Avatar set up on another model.
Root node
Select the bone to use as a root node for this Avatar.
This setting is only available if you set the
Avatar Definition
to
Create From This Model
.
Source
Copy another Avatar with an identical rig to import its animation clips.
This setting is only available if you set the
Avatar Definition
to
Copy from Other Avatar
.
Skin Weights
Set the maximum number of bones that can influence a single vertex. The following options are available:
Standard (4 Bones)
- Use a maximum influence of four bones. This is the default, and is recommended for performance.
Custom
- Set your own maximum number of bones. When you select this option, the
Max Bones/Vertex
and
Max Bone Weight
properties appear.
Max Bones/Vertex
Set the maximum number of bones per vertex to influence a given vertex. You can set between 1 and 32 bones per vertex, but the higher the number of bones you use to influence a vertex, the greater the performance cost.
This setting is only available you set the
Skin Weights
property to
Custom
.
Max Bone Weight
Set the bottom threshold for considering bone weights. The weighting calculation ignores anything smaller than this value, and Unity scales up the bone weights higher than this value to a total of 1.0.
This setting is only available if the
Skin Weights
property is set to
Custom
.
Strip Bones
Enable to only add bones to Skinned
Mesh Renderers
A mesh component that takes the geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the object’s Transform component.
More info
See in
Glossary
that have skin weights assigned to them.
Optimize Game Object
Remove and store the GameObject Transform hierarchy of the imported character in the Avatar and Animator component. If enabled, the SkinnedMeshRenderers of the character use the Unity animation system’s internal skeleton, which improves the performance of the animated characters.
Only available if the
Avatar Definition
is set to
Create From This Model
.
Extra Transforms to Expose
Specify which Transform paths you want Unity to ignore when
Optimize Game Object
is enabled. For more information, see
Including extra Transforms
.
This section only appears when
Optimize Game Object
is enabled.
Humanoid animation types
Your rig is
humanoid
(it has two legs, two arms and a head)
With rare exceptions, humanoid models have the same basic structure. This structure represents the major articulated parts of the body: the head and limbs. The first step to using Unity’s
Humanoid animation features
is to
set up and configure
an
Avatar
An interface for retargeting animation from one rig to another.
More info
See in
Glossary
. Unity uses the Avatar to map the simplified humanoid bone structure to the actual bones present in the Model’s skeleton.
Property
Description
Avatar Definition
Choose where to get the Avatar definition. The following options are available:
Create from this model
- Create an Avatar based on this model
Copy from Other Avatar
- Point to an Avatar set up on another model.
Source
Copy another Avatar with an identical rig to import its animation clips.
Only available if the
Avatar Definition
is set to
Copy from Other Avatar
.
Configure
Open the
Avatar configuration
.
Only available if the
Avatar Definition
is set to
Create From This Model
.
Skin Weights
This property is identical for both Humanoid and Generic Models. Refer to the
Skin Weights
property for
Generic
models above for more information.
Strip Bones
Enable to only add bones to Skinned Mesh Renderers that have skin weights assigned to them.
Optimize Game Object
Remove and store the GameObject Transform hierarchy of the imported character in the Avatar and Animator component. If enabled, the SkinnedMeshRenderers of the character use the Unity animation system’s internal skeleton, which improves the performance of the animated characters.
Only available if the
Avatar Definition
is set to
Create From This Model
.
Extra Transforms to Expose
Specify which Transform paths you want Unity to ignore when
Optimize Game Object
is enabled. For more information, see
Including extra Transforms
.
This section only appears when
Optimize Game Object
is enabled.
Including extra Transforms
When you enable the
Optimize Game Object
property, Unity ignores any Transform which is part of the hierarchy but is not mapped in the Avatar, in order to improve CPU performance. However, you can mark specific nodes in the
GameObject
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.
More info
See in
Glossary
hierarchy to include in calculations using the
Extra Transforms to Expose
section:
The Extra Transforms to Expose property appears when Optimize Game Objects is enabled
(A)
Enter the full or partial name in the search box to filter the list of Transforms. This makes it easier to navigate through characters with a large number of bones.
(B)
Enable each Transform (bones of a skeleton) you want Unity to include in calculations.
(C)
Use the buttons to help select specific Transforms. For example, the
Toggle All
button selects or deselects everything at once (regardless of the current selection, including filtered items).
(D)
Use the
Revert
button to undo your selections or the
Apply
button to apply the exceptions to the Model.
Note
: In optimized mode, skinned Mesh matrix extraction is multi-threaded.
