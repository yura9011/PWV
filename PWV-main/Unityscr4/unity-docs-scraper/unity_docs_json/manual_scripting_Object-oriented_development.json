Code is organized around\nGameObjects\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nwhose behavior is controlled by attached\nMonoBehaviour\ncomponents\nA functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n. In general, these MonoBehaviour components encapsulate logic (methods) and data (fields) together, which can be convenient but can have performance issues at scale.\nAn alternative to object-oriented development is data-oriented development, which is both a design philosophy and a set of technologies that help you implement that philosophy. This approach stresses a clear separation between code and data to maximize CPU cache efficiency and parallelism. Instead of MonoBehaviours, the\nEntity Component System (ECS)\narchitecture uses components for data, and systems for logic. The data-oriented approach offers strong performance advantages at scale but can be more challenging for inexperienced developers to learn.\nObject-oriented and data-oriented development are not mutually exclusive and you can combine elements from both. For information on data-oriented development, refer to\nUnity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack\n.\nTopic\nDescription\nFundamental Unity types\nUnderstand some of the fundamental C# types that Unity provides and their special significance and behavior in the Unity Editor and runtime.\nManaging update and execution order\nUnderstand the order in which Unity executes your script components and the lifecycle callbacks within those\nscripts\nA piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nduring the runtime application loop.\nManaging time and frame rate\nUnderstand how Unity measures time so you can manage the rate at which time passes in your application and ensure values update according to the appropriate time scale.\nSplit tasks across frames with coroutines\nSplit the execution of a task synchronously across multiple\nscenes\nA Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\nwith coroutines. This can be useful for tasks that should progress gradually over several frames, such as a fade out effect.\nInteracting with web servers\nUse the UnityWebRequest system to allow your application to interact with a web server via HTTP.\nHandle type data generically with Unity Properties\nUse the Unity Properties API to generically discover and manipulate object properties at runtime.\nProgramming with mathematics\nUse Unity’s mathematical APIs to apply trigonometric, logarithmic, and other functions in your application, move objects with vectors, and generate random values.\nAdditional resources\nUnity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack\nGameObject\nDiff tool support\nFundamental Unity types\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
