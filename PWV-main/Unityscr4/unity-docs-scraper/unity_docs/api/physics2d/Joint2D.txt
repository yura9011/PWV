// Unity Class: Joint2D
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html

// Description: Parent class for joints to connect Rigidbody2D objects.

// Properties:
// - attachedRigidbody: The Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
// - breakAction: The action to take when the joint breaks the breakForce or breakTorque.
// - breakForce: The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.
// - breakTorque: The torque that needs to be applied for this joint to break.
// - connectedBody: The Rigidbody2D object to which the other end of the joint is attached (ie, the object without the joint component).
// - enableCollision: Should the two Rigidbody2D connected with this joint collide with each other?
// - reactionForce: Gets the reaction force of the joint.
// - reactionTorque: Gets the reaction torque of the joint.

// Methods:
// - GetReactionForce: Gets the reaction force of the joint given the specified timeStep.
// - GetReactionTorque: Gets the reaction torque of the joint given the specified timeStep.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the AsyncInstantiateOperation.
