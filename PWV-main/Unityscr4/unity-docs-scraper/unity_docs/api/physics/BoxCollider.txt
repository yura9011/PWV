// Unity Class: BoxCollider
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html

// Description: A box-shaped primitive collider.

// Properties:
// - center: The center of the box, measured in the object's local space.
// - size: The size of the box, measured in the object's local space.

// Methods:
// - ClosestPoint(): The closest point on the collider given a specified location.
// - ClosestPointOnBounds(): The closest point to the bounding box of the attached collider.
// - GetGeometry(): Returns the geometric shape of the collider of the requested type.
// - Raycast(): Casts a Ray that ignores all Colliders except this one.
// - BroadcastMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.
// - CompareTag(): Checks the GameObject's tag against the defined tag.
// - GetComponent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentInChildren(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentIndex(): Gets the index of the component on its parent GameObject.
// - GetComponentInParent(): Gets a reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or any parent of the GameObject.
// - GetComponents(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.
// - GetComponentsInChildren(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any child of the GameObject.
// - GetComponentsInParent(): Gets references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, and any parent of the GameObject.
// - SendMessage(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.
// - SendMessageUpwards(): Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.
// - TryGetComponent(): Gets the component of the specified type, if it exists.
// - GetInstanceID(): Gets the instance ID of the object.
// - ToString(): Returns the name of the object.
