There are several ways you can improve performance, including avoiding bad practices,\nprofiling\nyour code, implementing appropriate design patterns, and using techniques like asynchronous programming to split work across multiple threads of execution.\nTopic\nDescription\nUnity programming best practices\nKey issues to be aware of when writing code for Unity applications, along with best practices to help you avoid common pitfalls.\nAsynchronous programming\nAsynchronous programming in Unity with the .NET\nasync\nand\nawait\nkeywords and Unity’s own custom\nAwaitable\nclass.\nJob system\nUse Unity’s own\nJob\nsystem to get the most out of multi-core CPUs and parallelize your algorithms.\nOptimizing your code for managed memory\nApproaches for optimizing your code to work with managed memory.\nUsing unmanaged API for transform operations\nUse the\nTransformHandle\nAPI as an alternative to the\nTransform\nAPI.\nAdditional resources\nOptimization in Unity\nNative plug-in API for logging\nUnity programming best practices\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
