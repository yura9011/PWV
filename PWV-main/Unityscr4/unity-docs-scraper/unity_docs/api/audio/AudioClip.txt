// Unity Class: AudioClip
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioClip.html

// Description: A container for audio data.

// Properties:
// - ambisonic: Returns true if this audio clip is ambisonic (read-only).
// - channels: The number of channels in the audio clip. (Read Only)
// - frequency: The sample frequency of the clip in Hertz. (Read Only)
// - length: The length of the audio clip in seconds. (Read Only)
// - loadInBackground: Enable this property to load the AudioClip asynchronously in the background instead of on the main thread. Set this property in the Inspector (Read Only).
// - loadState: Returns the current load state of the audio data associated with an AudioClip.
// - loadType: The load type of the clip (read-only).
// - preloadAudioData: Enable this property in the Inspector to preload audio data from the audio clip when loading the clip Asset (Read Only).
// - samples: The length of the audio clip in samples. (Read Only)

// Methods:
// - GetData(): Fills an array with sample data from the audio clip.
// - LoadAudioData(): Loads the asset data of an AudioClip into memory, so it will immediately be ready to play.
// - SetData(): Fills an audio clip with sample data from an array or Span. Overwrites existing data if necessary.
// - UnloadAudioData(): Unloads the audio data associated with the clip. This works only for AudioClips that are based on actual sound file assets.
