This allows you to go beyond what can be done in the Editor UI alone. Interacting directly with the public Unity APIs allows for finer control and a greater degree of customization.\nLearning to program in particular languages is beyond the scope of this section. However, there are many books, tutorials, and other resources for learning how to program with Unity. Refer to\nlearn\nfor further details.\nTopic\nDescription\nGet started with programming in Unity\nGet started with creating, naming, and editing your first Unity\nscripts\nA piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n.\nEnvironment and tools\nSet up your software development environment with the right tools for programming in Unity.\nObject-oriented development\nDevelop Unity projects with the traditional object-oriented programming philosophy and architecture.\nCompilation and code reload\nHow Unity transforms the code you write into code that runs, and the implications for development iteration times and your application’s runtime behavior.\nCode optimization\nProject configuration, design patterns, and coding strategies to help optimize the performance of your code.\nTesting your code\nUse the Unity Test Framework to write and run tests for your Editor or runtime code.\nDebugging and diagnostics\nDebug, diagnose, and fix problems in your code.\nAdditional resources and examples\n📖\nE-Book\n:\nUse a C# style guide for clean and scalable game code (Unity 6 edition)\n📖\nE-Book\n:\nLevel up your code with design patterns and SOLID\n📖\nE-Book\n:\nCreate modular game architecture in Unity with ScriptableObjects\n📖\nE-Book\n:\nIntroduction to the Data-Oriented Technology Stack for advanced Unity developers\n💡\nResources\n:\nUnity Learn Scripting tutorials\n💡\nResources\n:\nAn example of a Unity C# code style guide\n⚙️\nSample project\n:\nLevel up your code with design patterns and SOLID\n⚙️\nSample project\n:\nScriptableObjects Paddle Ball project\n📺\nVideo\n:\nTips for creating your own C# code style guide\n📺\nVideo\n:\nLevel up your code with game programming patterns: Command pattern\n📺\nVideo\n:\nLevel up your code with game programming patterns: Factory pattern\n📺\nVideo\n:\nLevel up your code with game programming patterns: Model-view-presenter\n📺\nVideo\n:\nLevel up your code with game programming design patterns: Object pool\n📺\nVideo\n:\nLevel up your code with game programming patterns: Pattern combo\n👥\nCommunity\n:\nScripting section at Unity Discussions\nFull Screen Pass Renderer Feature reference for URP\nGet started with programming in Unity\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
