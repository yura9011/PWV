You can use the following physics 2D components with Unity:\nPage\nDescription\nRigidbody 2D\nLearn how\nRigidbody\nA component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n2D works.\nCollider 2D\nUnderstand the types of\nCollider\nAn invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n2D components available to use with Rigidbody 2D.\nEffectors 2D\nApproaches and techniques to working with the forces of physics when\nGameObject\nThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\ncolliders are in contact.\n2D joints\nUnderstand the types of 2D\nJoints\nA physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\navailable to use with 2D GameObjects.\nPhysics 2D Profiler\nApproaches to analyzing the performance of 2D physics in your application.\nConstant Force 2D reference\nExplore the properties that control\nconstant forces\nA simple component for adding a constant force or torque to game objects with a Rigidbody.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\napplied to a Rigidbody 2D.\nPhysics Material 2D reference\nExplore the properties that control the friction and bounce between colliding 2D physics objects.\nAdditional resources\nPhysics 2D Manager\nPhysics section\nGrid component reference\nRigidbody 2D\nCopyright ©2005-2026 Unity Technologies.
