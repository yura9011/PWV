// Unity Class: AudioSource
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html

// Description: A representation of audio sources in 3D.

// Properties:
// - bypassEffects: Bypass effects (Applied from filter components or global listener filters).
// - bypassListenerEffects: When set, global effects on the AudioListener doesn't apply to the audio signal generated by the AudioSource. It also does'nt apply, if the AudioSource is playing into a mixer group.
// - bypassReverbZones: When set, it doesn't route the signal from an AudioSource into the global reverb associated with reverb zones.
// - clip: The default AudioClip to play.
// - dopplerLevel: Sets the Doppler scale for this AudioSource.
// - gamepadSpeakerOutputType: Gets or sets the gamepad audio output type for this audio source.
// - generator: The default IAudioGenerator to play next.
// - generatorInstance: A handle to the currently playing Generator, if it can be controlled by scripting.
// - ignoreListenerPause: Allows AudioSource to play even though AudioListener.pause is set to true. This is useful for the menu element sounds or background music in pause menus.
// - ignoreListenerVolume: This makes the audio source not take into account the volume of the audio listener.
// - isPlaying: Returns whether the AudioSource is currently playing an AudioResource(Read Only).
// - isVirtual: True if all sounds played by the AudioSource, such as main sound started by Play() or playOnAwake, and one-shots are culled by the audio system.
// - loop: Checks if the audio clip is looping
// - maxDistance: The distance where sound either becomes inaudible or stops attenuation, depending on the rolloff mode.
// - minDistance: Within the Min distance the AudioSource will cease to grow louder in volume.
// - mute: Un- / Mutes the AudioSource. Mute sets the volume=0, Un-Mute restore the original volume.
// - outputAudioMixerGroup: The target group to which the AudioSource should route its signal.
// - panStereo: Pans a playing sound in a stereo way (left or right). This only applies to sounds that are Mono or Stereo.
// - pitch: The pitch of the audio source.
// - playOnAwake: Enable this property to automatically play the audio source when the component or GameObject becomes active.
// - priority: Sets the priority of the AudioSource.
// - resource: The default AudioResource to play.
// - reverbZoneMix: The amount by which the signal from the AudioSource will be mixed into the global reverb associated with the Reverb Zones.
// - rolloffMode: Sets/Gets how the AudioSource attenuates over distance.
// - spatialBlend: Sets how much this AudioSource is affected by 3D spatialisation calculations (attenuation, doppler etc). 0.0 makes the sound full 2D, 1.0 makes it full 3D.
// - spatialize: Enables or disables spatialization.
// - spatializePostEffects: Determines if the spatializer effect is inserted before or after the effect filters.
// - spread: Sets the spread angle (in degrees) of a 3d stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space.
// - time: Audio source playback position in seconds.
// - timeSamples: The current playback position of the AudioSource in PCM samples.
// - velocityUpdateMode: Whether the Audio Source should be updated in the fixed or dynamic update.
// - volume: The volume of the audio source (0.0 to 1.0).

// Methods:
// - DisableGamepadOutput(): Disables audio output to a gamepad for this audio source.
// - GetAmbisonicDecoderFloat(): Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
// - GetCustomCurve(): Get the current custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.
// - GetOutputData(): Provides a block of the currently playing source's output data.
// - GetSpatializerFloat(): Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
// - GetSpectrumData(): Provides the block of audio frequencies (spectrum data) of the AudioSource that is currently playing.
// - Pause(): Pauses playing the clip.
// - Play(): Plays the clip.
// - PlayDelayed(): Plays the clip with a delay specified in seconds. Users are advised to use this function instead of the old Play(delay) function that took a delay specified in samples relative to a reference rate of 44.1 kHz as an argument.
// - PlayOneShot(): Plays an AudioClip, and scales the AudioSource volume by volumeScale.
// - PlayOnGamepad(): Enable the audio source to play through a specific gamepad.
// - PlayScheduled(): Plays the clip at a specific time on the absolute time-line that AudioSettings.dspTime reads from.
// - SetAmbisonicDecoderFloat(): Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
// - SetCustomCurve(): Set the custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.
// - SetScheduledEndTime(): Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will end. Notice that depending on the timing not all rescheduling requests can be fulfilled.
// - SetScheduledStartTime(): Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will start.
// - SetSpatializerFloat(): Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
// - Stop(): Stops playing the clip.
// - UnPause(): Unpause the paused playback of this AudioSource.

// Code Examples:
// Example 1:
//   //This script allows you to toggle music to play and stop.
//   //Assign an AudioSource to a GameObject and attach an Audio Clip in the Audio Source. Attach this script to the GameObject.using UnityEngine;public class Example : MonoBehaviour
//   {
//       AudioSource m_MyAudioSource;    //Play the music
//       bool m_Play;
//       //Detect when you use the toggle, ensures music isn’t played multiple times
//       bool m_ToggleChange;    void Start()
//       {
//           //Fetch the AudioSource from the GameObject
//           m_MyAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
//           //Ensure the toggle is set to true for the music to play at start-up
//           m_Play = true;
//       }    void Update()
//       {
//           //Check to see if you just set the toggle to positive
//           if (m_Play == true && m_ToggleChange == true)
//           {
//               //Play the audio you attach to the AudioSource component
//               m_MyAudioSource.Play();
//               //Ensure audio doesn’t play more than once
//               m_ToggleChange = false;
//           }
//           //Check if you just set the toggle to false
//           if (m_Play == false && m_ToggleChange == true)
//           {
//               //Stop the audio
//               m_MyAudioSource.Stop();
//               //Ensure audio doesn’t play more than once
//               m_ToggleChange = false;
//           }
//       }    void OnGUI()
//       {
//           //Switch this toggle to activate and deactivate the parent GameObject
//           m_Play = GUI.Toggle(new Rect(10, 10, 100, 30), m_Play, "Play Music");        //Detect if there is a change with the toggle
//           if (GUI.changed)
//           {
//               //Change to true to show that there was just a change in the toggle state
//               m_ToggleChange = true;
//           }
//       }
