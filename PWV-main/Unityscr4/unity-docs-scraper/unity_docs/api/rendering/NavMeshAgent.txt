// Unity Class: NavMeshAgent
// Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/NavMeshAgent.html

// Description: Navigation mesh agent.

// Properties:
// - acceleration: The maximum acceleration of an agent as it follows a path, given in units / sec^2.
// - agentTypeID: The type ID for the agent.
// - angularSpeed: Maximum turning speed in (deg/s) while following a path.
// - areaMask: Specifies which NavMesh areas are passable. Changing areaMask will make the path stale (see isPathStale).
// - autoBraking: Should the agent brake automatically to avoid overshooting the destination point?
// - autoRepath: Should the agent attempt to acquire a new path if the existing path becomes invalid?
// - autoTraverseOffMeshLink: Should the agent move across OffMeshLinks automatically?
// - avoidancePriority: The avoidance priority level.
// - baseOffset: The relative vertical displacement of the owning GameObject.
// - currentOffMeshLinkData: The current OffMeshLinkData.
// - desiredVelocity: The desired velocity of the agent including any potential contribution from avoidance. (Read Only)
// - destination: Gets or attempts to set the destination of the agent in world-space units.
// - hasPath: Does the agent currently have a path? (Read Only)
// - height: The height of the agent for purposes of passing under obstacles, etc.
// - isOnNavMesh: Is the agent currently bound to the navmesh? (Read Only)
// - isOnOffMeshLink: Is the agent currently positioned on an OffMeshLink? (Read Only)
// - isPathStale: Is the current path stale. (Read Only)
// - isStopped: Use this property to set, or get, whether the NavMesh agent stops or continues its movement along the current path.
// - navMeshOwner: Returns the owning object of the NavMesh the agent is currently placed on (Read Only).
// - nextOffMeshLinkData: The next OffMeshLinkData on the current path.
// - nextPosition: Gets or sets the simulation position of the navmesh agent.
// - obstacleAvoidanceType: The level of quality of avoidance.
// - path: Property to get and set the current path.
// - pathPending: Is a path in the process of being computed but not yet ready? (Read Only)
// - pathStatus: The status of the current path (complete, partial or invalid).
// - radius: The avoidance radius for the agent.
// - remainingDistance: The distance between the agent's position and the destination on the current path. (Read Only)
// - speed: Maximum movement speed when following a path.
// - steeringTarget: Get the current steering target along the path. (Read Only)
// - stoppingDistance: Stop within this distance from the target position.
// - updatePosition: Gets or sets whether the transform position is synchronized with the simulated agent position. The default value is true.
// - updateRotation: Should the agent update the transform orientation?
// - updateUpAxis: Allows you to specify whether the agent should be aligned to the up-axis of the NavMesh or link that it is placed on.
// - velocity: Access the current velocity of the NavMeshAgent component, or set a velocity to control the agent manually.

// Methods:
// - ActivateCurrentOffMeshLink: Enables or disables the current off-mesh link.
// - CalculatePath: Calculate a path to a specified point and store the resulting path.
// - CompleteOffMeshLink: Completes the movement on the current OffMeshLink.
// - FindClosestEdge: Locate the closest NavMesh edge.
// - GetAreaCost: Gets the cost for path calculation when crossing area of a particular type.
// - Move: Apply relative movement to current position.
// - Raycast: Trace a straight path towards a target postion in the NavMesh without moving the agent.
// - ResetPath: Clears the current path.
// - SamplePathPosition: Sample a position along the current path.
// - SetAreaCost: Sets the cost for traversing over areas of the area type.
// - SetDestination: Sets or updates the destination thus triggering the calculation for a new path.
// - SetPath: Assign a new path to this agent.
// - Warp: Warps agent to the provided position.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the AsyncInstantiateOperation.
