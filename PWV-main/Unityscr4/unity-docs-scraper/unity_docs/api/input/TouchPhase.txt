//   using System.Collections;
//   using UnityEngine.UI;public class TouchPhaseExample : MonoBehaviour
//   {
//       public Vector2 startPos;
//       public Vector2 direction;    public Text m_Text;
//       string message;    void Update()
//       {
//           //Update the Text on the screen depending on current TouchPhase, and the current direction vector
//           m_Text.text = "Touch : " + message + "in direction" + direction;        // Track a single touch as a direction control.
//           if (Input.touchCount > 0)
//           {
//               Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);            // Handle finger movements based on TouchPhase
//               switch (touch.phase)
//               {
//                   //When a touch has first been detected, change the message and record the starting position
//                   case TouchPhase.Began:
//                       // Record initial touch position.
