2D renderer sorting
Overview
Unity sorts Renderers according to a priority order that depends on their types and usages. You can specify the render order of Renderers through their
Render Queue
. In general, there are two main queues: the
Opaque queue
and the
Transparent queue
. 2D Renderers are mainly within the Transparent queue, and include the
Sprite Renderer
A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes.

See in
Glossary
,
Tilemap Renderer
, and
Sprite Shape Renderer
types.
Transparent Queue Sorting Order by Priority
2D Renderers within the Transparent Queue generally follow the priority order below:
Sorting Layer and Order in Layer
Specify Render Queue
Distance to Camera
Perspective
Orthographic
Custom Axis sort mode
Sprite Sort Point
Sorting Group
Material/Shader
Tiebreaker
There are other factors which can cause the sorting order to differ from the regular priority order. These factors vary from project to project.
Sorting Layer and Order in Layer
The
Sorting Layer
and
Order in Layer
(in the Renderer’s
Property
settings) are available to all 2D Renderers through the
Inspector
A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.
More info
See in
Glossary
window or via the Unity Scripting API. Set the Renderer to an existing
Sorting Layer
or create a new one to determine its priority in the rendering queue. Change the value of the
Order in Layer
to set the Renderer’s priority among other Renderers within the same
Sorting Layer
.
Specify Render Queue
You can specify the Render Queue type of the Renderer in its Material settings or in the
Shader
A program that runs on the GPU.

See in
Glossary
settings of its Material. This is useful for grouping and sorting Renderers which are using different Materials. Refer to documentation on
ShaderLab: SubShader Tags
for more details.
Distance to Camera
The
Camera component
sorts Renderers based on its
Projection
setting. The two options are
Perspective
and
Orthographic
.
Perspective
In this mode, the sorting distance of a Renderer is the direct distance of the Renderer from the
Camera
A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture.

Glossary
’s position.
Orthographic
The sorting distance of a Renderer is the distance between the position of the Renderer and the Camera along the Camera’s view direction. For the default 2D setting, this is along the (0, 0, 1) axis.
When you set the Camera component to
Perspective
or
Orthographic,
Unity automatically sets the Camera’s
TransparencySortMode
to match the selected mode. You can set the Transparency Sort Mode manually in two ways:
Open the
Project Settings
A broad collection of settings which allow you to configure how Physics, Audio, Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your project behave.
More info
See in
Glossary
and go to
Graphics
, then under
Camera Settings
use Transparent Sort Mode
Set the Camera’s
TransparencySortMode
via the Scripting API.
The Camera
Transparency Sort Mode
settings are under the
Graphics
category in the
Project Settings
(main menu:
Edit
>
Project Settings
>
Graphics
). When this is set to
Default
, a Camera component’s Projection setting take priority. When this is set to an option other than
Default
, the Camera component’s Projection setting remains the same, but the Camera’s
Transparency Sort Mode
changes to that option.
An additional option available through the Project settings and via the Scripting API is the
Custom Axis sort mode
.
Custom Axis sort mode
Select this mode to sort Renderers based on their distance along the custom axis you set in the Project settings (main menu:
Edit
>
Project Settings
>
Graphics
>
Transparency Sort Axis
). This is commonly used in projects with
Isometric Tilemaps
to sort and render the Tile Sprites correctly on the Tilemap. Refer to
Creating an Isometric Tilemap
for further information.
Note:
If your project is a 2D Universal
Render Pipeline
A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.

(URP) project, the
Transparency Sort Mode
isn’t available in the
Project Settings
, and is instead configured in the 2D Renderer asset properties. Refer to the
Configure the 2D Renderer Asset documentation
for more information.
Sprite Sort Point
By default, a
Sprite
A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.
More info
See in
Glossary
’s
Sort Point
is set to its
Center
, and Unity measures the distance between the camera’s Transform position and the Center of the Sprite to determine their render order during sorting. An alternate option is to set a Sprite’s
Sort Point
to its
Pivot
position in World Space. Select the
Pivot
option in the Sprite’s
Sprite Renderer
property settings and edit the Sprite’s Pivot position in the
Sprite Editor
.
Sorting Group
The
Sorting Group
is a component that groups Renderers which share a common root together for sorting purposes. All Renderers within the same Sorting Group share the same
Sorting Layer, Order in Layer,
and
Distance to Camera
. Refer to documentation on the
Sorting Group
component and its settings for more details.
Material/Shader
Unity sorts Renderers with the same
Material settings
together for more efficient rendering performance, such as with
dynamic batching
An automatic Unity process which attempts to render multiple meshes as if they were a single mesh for optimized graphics performance. The technique transforms all of the GameObject vertices on the CPU and groups many similar vertices together.
More info
See in
Glossary
.
Tiebreaker
When multiple Renderers have identical sorting priority, the tiebreaker is the order that Unity places the Renderers in the Render Queue. Because this is an internal process that you have no control over, you should use the sorting options (such as
Sorting Layers
and
Sorting Groups
) to make sure all Renderers have distinct sorting priorities.
