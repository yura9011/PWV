UI Toolkit
Comparison of UI systems in Unity
UI Toolkit
is intended to become the recommended UI system for you to develop UI in your projects. However, in its current release, UI Toolkit does not have some features that
uGUI (Unity UI)
and
IMGUI (Immediate Mode GUI)
support. uGUI and IMGUI are more appropriate for certain use cases, and are required to support legacy projects.
This page provides a high-level feature comparison of UI Toolkit, uGUI, and IMGUI, and their respective approaches to UI design.
General consideration
The following table lists the recommended and alternative system for runtime and Editor:
Unity 6.3
Recommendation
Alternative
Runtime
uGUI (Unity UI)
UI Toolkit
Editor
UI Toolkit
IMGUI
Roles and skill sets
Your team’s skill set and comfort level with different technologies is also an important consideration.
The following table lists the recommended system for different roles:

Skill sets
Programmer
✅
✅
✅
Programmers can use any game development tool or API.
Technical Artist
Partial
✅
❌
Technical artists who are familiar with Unity’s GameObject-based tools and workflows are likely to be comfortable working with GameObjects, Components, and the Scene view.
They might not be comfortable with UI Toolkit’s web-like approach or IMGUI’s pure C# approach.
UI Designer
✅
Partial
❌
UI designers who are familiar with UI creation tools are likely to be comfortable with UI Toolkit’s document-based approach and can use the
UI Builder
to visually edit their UI.
If they are not familiar with GameObject-based workflows, they might require help from programmers or level designers.
Innovation and development
UI Toolkit is in active development and releases new features frequently. uGUI and IMGUI are established and production-proven UI systems that are updated infrequently.
uGUI and IMGUI might be better choices if you need features that are not yet available in UI Toolkit, or you need to support or reuse older UI content.
Runtime
UI Toolkit is an alternative to uGUI (Unity UI) if you create a screen overlay UI that runs on a wide variety of screen resolutions. Consider UI Toolkit to do the following:
Produce work with a significant amount of user interfaces
Require familiar authoring workflows for artists and designers
Seek textureless UI rendering capabilities
UI positioned and lit in a 3D world
Advanced visuals with custom
shaders
A program that runs on the GPU.

Editor
UI Toolkit is recommended if you create complex editor tools. UI Toolkit is also recommended for the following reasons:
Better reusability and decoupling
Visual tools for authoring UI
Better scalability for code maintenance and performance
IMGUI is an alternative to UI Toolkit for the following:
Unrestricted access to editor extensible capabilities
Light API to quickly render UI on screen
Use Cases
The following table lists the recommended system for major Editor use cases:
Unity 6.3
Recommendation
Complex editor tool
UI Toolkit
Property drawers
A Unity feature that allows you to customize the look of certain controls in the Inspector window by using attributes on your scripts, or by controlling how a specific Serializable class should look
