However, you also have the option of switching the Editor between 2D mode and 3D mode at any time. You can read more about\nthe difference between 2D and 3D Projects here\n. This page provides information about how to switch modes, and what exactly changes within the editor when you do.\nSwitching between 3D and 2D modes\nTo change modes between 2D or 3D mode:\nOpen the\nEditor\nsettings (top menu:\nEdit > Project Settings\n, then select the\nEditor\ncategory).\nThen set\nDefault Behavior Mode\nto either\n2D\nor\n3D\n.\nUse the Default Behavior Mode setting in the Editor settings to set the Project to 2D or 3D\n2D vs 3D mode settings\n2D or 3D mode determines some settings for the Unity Editor. These are listed below.\nIn 2D Project mode:\nAny images you import are assumed to be 2D images (\nSprites\nA 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.\nMore info\nSee in\nGlossary\n) and set to\nSprite\nmode.\nThe\nScene View\nAn interactive view into the world you are creating.
