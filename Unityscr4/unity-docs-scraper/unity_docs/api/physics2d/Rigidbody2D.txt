// - worldCenterOfMass: Gets the center of mass of the rigidBody in global space.

// Methods:
// - AddForce: Apply a force to the rigidbody.
// - AddForceAtPosition: Apply a force at a given position in space.
// - AddForceX: Adds a force to the X component of the Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity only leaving the Y component of the world space Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity untouched.
// - AddForceY: Adds a force to the Y component of the Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity only leaving the X component of the world space Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity untouched.
// - AddRelativeForce: Adds a force to the local space Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity. In other words, the force is applied in the rotated coordinate space of the Rigidbody2D.
// - AddRelativeForceX: Adds a force to the X component of the Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity in the local space of the Rigidbody2D only leaving the Y component of the local space Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity untouched.
// - AddRelativeForceY: Adds a force to the Y component of the Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity in the local space of the Rigidbody2D only leaving the X component of the local space Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity untouched.
// - AddTorque: Apply a torque at the rigidbody's centre of mass.
// - Cast: All the Collider2D shapes attached to the Rigidbody2D are cast into the Scene starting at each Collider position ignoring the Colliders attached to the same Rigidbody2D.
// - ClosestPoint: Returns a point on the perimeter of all enabled Colliders attached to this Rigidbody that is closest to the specified position.
// - Distance: Calculates the minimum distance of this collider against all Collider2D attached to this Rigidbody2D.
// - GetAttachedColliders: Returns all Collider2D that are attached to this Rigidbody2D.
// - GetContacts: Retrieves all contact points for all of the Collider(s) attached to this Rigidbody.
// - GetPoint: Get a local space point given the point point in rigidBody global space.
// - GetPointVelocity: The velocity of the rigidbody at the point Point in global space.
// - GetRelativePoint: Get a global space point given the point relativePoint in rigidBody local space.
// - GetRelativePointVelocity: The velocity of the rigidbody at the point Point in local space.
// - GetRelativeVector: Get a global space vector given the vector relativeVector in rigidBody local space.
// - GetShapes: Gets all the PhysicsShape2D used by all Collider2D attached to the Rigidbody2D.
// - GetVector: Get a local space vector given the vector vector in rigidBody global space.
// - IsAwake: Is the rigidbody "awake"?
// - IsSleeping: Is the rigidbody "sleeping"?
// - IsTouching: Checks whether the collider is touching any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody or not.
// - IsTouchingLayers: Checks whether any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody are touching any colliders on the specified layerMask or not.
// - MovePosition: Moves the rigidbody to position.
// - MovePositionAndRotation: Moves the rigidbody position to position and the rigidbody angle to angle.
// - MoveRotation: Rotates the Rigidbody to angle (given in degrees).
// - Overlap: Get a list of all Colliders that overlap all Colliders attached to this Rigidbody2D.
// - OverlapPoint: Check if any of the Rigidbody2D colliders overlap a point in space.
// - SetRotation: Sets the rotation of the Rigidbody2D to angle (given in degrees).
// - Sleep: Make the rigidbody "sleep".
// - Slide: Slide the Rigidbody2D using the specified velocity integrated over deltaTime using the configuration specified by slideMovement.
// - WakeUp: Disables the "sleeping" state of a rigidbody.
// - Destroy: Removes a GameObject, component, or asset.
// - DestroyImmediate: Destroys the specified object immediately. Use with caution and in Edit mode only.
// - DontDestroyOnLoad: Do not destroy the target Object when loading a new Scene.
// - FindAnyObjectByType: Retrieves any active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindFirstObjectByType: Retrieves the first active loaded object of Type type.
// - FindObjectsByType: Retrieves a list of all loaded objects of Type type.
// - Instantiate: Clones the object original and returns the clone.
// - InstantiateAsync: Captures a snapshot of the original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the AsyncInstantiateOperation.
